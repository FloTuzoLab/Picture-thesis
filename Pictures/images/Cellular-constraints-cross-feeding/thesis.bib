	Abstract = {Phenotypic heterogeneity refers to genetically identical individuals that express different phenotypes, even when in the same environment. Traditionally, ``bet-hedging''in fluctuating environments is offered as the explanation for the evolution of phenotypic heterogeneity. However, there are an increasing number of examples of microbial populations that display phenotypic heterogeneity in stable environments. Here we present an evolutionary model of phenotypic heterogeneity of microbial metabolism and a resultant theory for the evolution of phenotypic versus genetic specialization. We use two-dimensional adaptive dynamics to track the evolution of the population phenotype distribution of the expression of two metabolic processes with a concave trade-off. Rather than assume a Gaussian phenotype distribution, we use a Beta distribution that is capable of describing genotypes that manifest as individuals with two distinct phenotypes. Doing so, we find that environmental variation is not a necessary condition for the evolution of phenotypic heterogeneity, which can evolve as a form of specialization in a stable environment. There are two competing pressures driving the evolution of specialization: directional selection toward the evolution of phenotypic heterogeneity and disruptive selection toward genetically determined specialists. Because of the lack of a singular point in the two-dimensional adaptive dynamics and the fact that directional selection is a first order process, while disruptive selection is of second order, the evolution of phenotypic heterogeneity dominates and often precludes speciation. We find that branching, and therefore genetic specialization, occurs mainly under two conditions: the presence of a cost to maintaining a high phenotypic variance or when the effect of mutations is large. A cost to high phenotypic variance dampens the strength of selection toward phenotypic heterogeneity and, when sufficiently large, introduces a singular point into the evolutionary dynamics, effectively guaranteeing eventual branching. Large mutations allow the second order disruptive selection to dominate the first order selection toward phenotypic heterogeneity.},

@article{Geritz98,
	Abstract = {We present a general framework for modelling adaptive trait dynamics in which we integrate various concepts and techniques from modern ESS-theory. The concept of evolutionarily singular strategies is introduced as a generalization of the ESS-concept. We give a full classification of the singular strategies in terms of ESS-stability, convergence stability, the ability of the singular strategy to invade other populations if initially rare itself, and the possibility of protected dimorphisms occurring within the singular strategy's neighbourhood. Of particular interest is a type of singular strategy that is an evolutionary attractor from a great distance, but once in its neighbourhood a population becomes dimorphic and undergoes disruptive selection leading to evolutionary branching. Modelling the adaptive growth and branching of the evolutionary tree can thus be considered as a major application of the framework. A haploid version of Levene's `soft selection'model is developed as a specific example to demonstrate evolutionary dynamics and branching in monomorphic and polymorphic populations.},

@article{Li11,
	Abstract = {A database of thermodynamic properties is developed, which extends a previous database of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle by adding the reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway. The raw data and documented estimations of solution properties are made electronically available. The database is determined by estimation of a set of parameters representing species-level free energies of formation. The resulting calculations provide thermodynamic and network-based estimates of thermodynamic properties for six reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway for which estimates are not available in the preexisting literature. Optimized results are made available in ThermoML format. Because calculations depend on estimated hydrogen and metal cation dissociation constants, an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is performed, revealing 23 critical dissociation constants to which the computed thermodynamic properties are particularly sensitive.Database URL:http://www.biocoda.org/thermo},

@article{Pinhal19,
	Abstract = {During aerobic growth on glucose, Escherichia coli excretes acetate, a mechanism called "overflow metabolism." At high concentrations, the secreted acetate inhibits growth. Several mechanisms have been proposed for explaining this phenomenon, but a thorough analysis is hampered by the diversity of experimental conditions and strains used in these studies. Here, we describe the construction of a set of isogenic strains that remove different parts of the metabolic network involved in acetate metabolism. Analysis of these strains reveals that (i) high concentrations of acetate in the medium inhibit growth without significantly perturbing central metabolism; (ii) growth inhibition persists even when acetate assimilation is completely blocked; and (iii) regulatory interactions mediated by acetyl-phosphate play a small but significant role in growth inhibition by acetate. The major contribution to growth inhibition by acetate may originate in systemic effects like the uncoupling effect of organic acids or the perturbation of the anion composition of the cell, as previously proposed. Our data suggest, however, that under the conditions considered here, the uncoupling effect plays only a limited role.IMPORTANCE High concentrations of organic acids such as acetate inhibit growth of Escherichia coli and other bacteria. This phenomenon is of interest for understanding bacterial physiology but is also of practical relevance. Growth inhibition by organic acids underlies food preservation and causes problems during high-density fermentation in biotechnology. What causes this phenomenon? Classical explanations invoke the uncoupling effect of acetate and the establishment of an anion imbalance. Here, we propose and investigate an alternative hypothesis: the perturbation of acetate metabolism due to the inflow of excess acetate. We find that this perturbation accounts for 20{\%} of the growth-inhibitory effect through a modification of the acetyl phosphate concentration. Moreover, we argue that our observations are not expected based on uncoupling alone.},

	Abstract = {Eukaryotic cells attempt to maintain an optimal size, resulting in size homeostasis. While cellular content scales isometrically with cell size, allometric laws indicate that metabolism per mass unit should decline with increasing size. Here we use elutriation and single-cell flow cytometry to analyze mitochondrial scaling with cell size. While mitochondrial content increases linearly, mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative phosphorylation are highest at intermediate cell sizes. Thus, mitochondrial content and functional scaling are uncoupled. The nonlinearity of mitochondrial functionality is cell size, not cell cycle, dependent, and it results in an optimal cell size whereby cellular fitness and proliferative capacity are maximized. While optimal cell size is controlled by growth factor signaling, its establishment and maintenance requires mitochondrial dynamics, which can be controlled by the mevalonate pathway. Thus, optimization of cellular fitness and functionality through mitochondria can explain the requirement for size control, as well as provide means for its maintenance.},

This striking observation comes from experimental evolution of bacteria, which create new ecological niches when they excrete nutrient-rich waste products that can sustain the life of other bacteria. It is difficult to estimate the potential of any one organism for such metabolic niche construction experimentally, because it is challenging to screen for novel metabolic abilities on a large scale. We therefore used experimentally validated models of bacterial metabolism to predict how many novel niches organisms like Escherichia coli can construct, if a novel niche must be able to sustain a stable community of microbes that differ in the nutrients they consume. We identify thousands of such niches. They differ in their primary carbon source and a secondary carbon source that is excreted by some microbes and used by others. Because we restricted ourselves to chemically simple environments, we may even have underestimated the enormous potential of microbes for niche construction.},

@article{Good17,
	Abstract = {The outcomes of evolution are determined by a stochastic dynamical process that governs how mutations arise and spread through a population. However, it is difficult to observe these dynamics directly over long periods and across entire genomes. Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve experimental populations of Escherichia coli, using whole-genome metagenomic sequencing at five hundred-generation intervals through sixty thousand generations. Although the rate of fitness gain declines over time, molecular evolution is characterized by signatures of rapid adaptation throughout the duration of the experiment, with multiple beneficial variants simultaneously competing for dominance in each population. Interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes play an important role, as long-term quasi-stable coexistence arises spontaneously in most populations, and evolution continues within each clade. We also present evidence that the targets of natural selection change over time, as epistasis and historical contingency alter the strength of selection on different genes. Together, these results show that long-term adaptation to a constant environment can be a more complex and dynamic process than is often assumed.},

Using laboratory experimental evolution we can control this variation. We previously showed that a population of E. coli that originated from a single clone and was cultured in the presence of a single limiting resource, evolves into a stable, three-membered community, wherein one clone excretes metabolites that the others utilize as carbon sources. To discern the genetic factors at work in producing this outcome and to illuminate the community's physiology, we sequenced the genomes of the ancestral and evolved clones. We identified in the ancestor mutations that may have predisposed evolution of cross-feeding. We found that the lineages which gave rise to the community diverged early on, and that the numerically dominant lineage that best scavenges limiting glucose does so as a result of adaptive mutations that enhance glucose uptake but favor fermentative over respiratory pathways, resulting in overflow metabolites. Because this clone produces secondary resources that sustain other community members, and because it shares with them only one mutation, we conclude that it is an ``engine''generating diversity by creating new niches, but not the occupants themselves.},

To evaluate this hypothesis, I review the literature on selection experiments in heterogeneous environments. The niche width usually ? but not invariably ? evolves to match the amount of environmental variation, specialists evolving in homogeneous environments and generalists evolving in heterogeneous environments. The genetics of niche width are more complex than has previously been recognized, particularly with respect to the magnitude of costs of adaptation and the putative constraints on the evolution of generalists. Genetic variation in fitness is more readily maintained in heterogeneous environments than in homogeneous environments and this diversity is often stably maintained through negative frequency-dependent selection. Moreover environmental heterogeneity appears to be a plausible mechanism for at least two well-known patterns of species diversity at the landscape scale. I conclude that environmental heterogeneity is a plausible and possibly very general explanation for diversity across the range of scales from individuals to landscapes.},

However, very few studies have addressed the question of how enzyme concentrations change in response to positive selective pressure on the flux, considered a proxy of fitness. In particular, the way cellular constraints, such as resource limitations and co-regulation, affect the adaptive landscape of a pathway under selection has never been analyzed theoretically. To fill this gap, we developed a model of the evolution of enzyme concentrations that combines metabolic control theory and an adaptive dynamics approach, and integrates possible dependencies between enzyme concentrations. We determined the evolutionary equilibria of enzyme concentrations and their range of neutral variation, and showed that they differ with the properties of the enzymes, the constraints applied to the system and the initial enzyme concentrations. Simulations of long-term evolution confirmed all analytical and numerical predictions, even though we relaxed the simplifying assumptions used in the analytical treatment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Latin symbolsAiPseudo-activity of enzyme i (the parameter includes the kinetic properties of the enzyme and thermodynamic equilibrium of upstream reactions)AVector of pseudo-activitiesBiGlobal co-regulation coefficient, representing effect of a mutation of Ei on Etot due to co-regulationEiConcentration of enzyme iInitial concentration of enzyme iEVector of enzyme concentrations, considered as the genotypeE0Vector of initial enzyme concentrationsE(1)Vector of enzyme concentrations after a mutationE(2)Vector of enzyme concentrations after a mutation and the application of a constraint on EtotEmVector of enzyme concentrations of the mutantErVector of enzyme concentrations of the residentE(t)Vector of concentrations at time tEtotTotal enzyme concentration in the metabolic pathwayInitial total enzyme concentrationeiRelative concentration of enzyme iInitial relative concentration of enzyme ieVector of relative enzyme concentrationse0Vector of initial relative enzyme concentrationse*Theoretical equilibrium of relative enzyme concentrationsEffective equilibrium of relative enzyme concentrations, corresponding to a maximum of the fluxεLine in the space of relative enzyme concentrations along which the relative concentrations vary in the case of co-regulationJMetabolic flux, considered as a phenotype that is proportional to fitnessFlux resulting from a mutation targeting enzyme iJrFlux of the residentKiEquilibrium constant of reaction i, catalyzed by enzyme iK1,iProduct of the equilibrium constants from the first to the ith reaction: Catalytic constant of enzyme iMichaelis-Menten constant of enzyme i for its substrateMβMatrix of co-regulation coefficientsNEffective population sizenNumber of enzymes in the metabolic pathwayPfFixation probability of a mutationFlux response coefficient of enzyme iSiMetabolite i, product of reaction i and substrate of reaction i + 1siSelection coefficient of a mutation targeting enzyme itEvolutionary timewFitnesswmMutant fitnesswrResident fitnessXConstant representing the environment: X = X0 −Xn/ K1,nX0Concentration of the input substrate of the pathwayXnConcentration of the output product of the pathwayGreek symbolsαijRedistribution coefficient, expressing the variation of Ej due to mutation affecting enzyme iβijCo-regulation coefficient of enzyme i on jγijCompetition coefficient, expression of αij in the case of competition aloneδiActual effect of a mutation affecting enzyme iμMutation rate at each time unitνCanonical effect of a mutationτDriving variable of the line εin the space of relative enzyme concentrations in the case of co-regulation.},

	Abstract = {A classic problem in microbiology is that bacteria display two types of growth behavior when cultured on a mixture of two carbon sources: the two sources are sequentially consumed one after another (diauxie) or they are simultaneously consumed (co-utilization). The search for the molecular mechanism of diauxie led to the discovery of the lac operon. However, questions remain as why microbes would bother to have different strategies of taking up nutrients. Here we show that diauxie versus co-utilization can be understood from the topological features of the metabolic network. A model of optimal allocation of protein resources quantitatively explains why and how the cell makes the choice. In case of co-utilization, the model predicts the percentage of each carbon source in supplying the amino acid pools, which is quantitatively verified by experiments. Our work solves a long-standing puzzle and provides a quantitative framework for the carbon source utilization of microbes.},

	Abstract = {Division of labour is a common feature of social groups, from biofilms to complex animal societies. However, we lack a theoretical framework that can explain why division of labour has evolved on certain branches of the tree of life but not others. Here, we model the division of labour over a cooperative behaviour, considering both when it should evolve and the extent to which the different types should become specialized. We found that: (1) division of labour is usually---but not always---favoured by high efficiency benefits to specialization and low within-group conflict; and (2) natural selection favours extreme specialization, where some individuals are completely dependent on the helping behaviour of others. We make a number of predictions, several of which are supported by the existing empirical data, from microbes and animals, while others suggest novel directions for empirical work. More generally, we show how division of labour can lead to mutual dependence between different individuals and hence drive major evolutionary transitions, such as those to multicellularity and eusociality.},

I show by comparing the fitness of individuals with that of collectives of individuals in the same environment and over the same period of time ? as required to decide if one or more levels of selection is acting in a population ? that the selection of collectives is a by-product of selection at the individual level; thus, talking about two or more levels of selection represents merely a different perspective on one and the same process.},

@article{Bourrat19,
	Abstract = {With a few exceptions, the literature on evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs) has mostly focused on the relationships between lower-level (particle-level) and higher-level (collective-level) selection, leaving aside the question of the relationship between particle-level and collective-level inheritance. Yet, without an account of this relationship, our hope to fully understand the evolutionary mechanisms underlying ETIs is impeded. To that effect, I present a highly idealized model to study the relationship between particle-level and collective-level heritability both when a collective-level trait is a linear function and when it is a nonlinear function of a particle-level trait. I first show that when a collective trait is a linear function of a particle-level trait, collective-level heritability is a by-product of particle-level heritability. It is equal to particle-level heritability, whether the particles interact randomly or not to form collectives. Second, I show that one effect of population structure is the reduction in variance in offspring collective-level character for a given parental collective. I propose that this reduction in variance is one dimension of individuality. Third, I show that even in the simple case of a nonlinear collective-level character, collective-level heritability is not only weak but also highly dependent on the frequency of the different types of particles in the global population. Finally, I show that population structure, because one of its effects is to reduce the variance in offspring collective-level character, allows not only for an increase in collective-level character but renders it less context dependent. This in turn permits a stable collective-level response to selection. The upshot is that population structure is a driver for ETIs. These results are particularly significant in that the relationship between population structure and collective-level heritability has, to my knowledge, not been previously explored in the context of ETIs.},

The controversy between Fisher and Wright has had a more fundamental and lasting impact upon evolutionary biology than any other controversy or rivalry in this century. Indeed, the controversy did not end with Fisher's death. Since 1962, Wright has produced a steady stream of papers and his four volume Evolution and the Genetics of Populations (1968, 1969, 1977, 1978a) in which he constantly contrasts his interpretations with those of Fisher.

@article{Coyne97,
	Abstract = {{$[$}We evaluate Sewall Wright's three-phase 'shifting balance' theory of evolution, examining both the theoretical issues and the relevant data from nature and the laboratory. We conclude that while phases I and II of Wright's theory (the movement of populations from one 'adaptive peak' to another via drift and selection) can occur under some conditions, genetic drift is often unnecessary for movement between peaks. Phase III of the shifting balance, in which adaptations spread from particular populations to the entire species, faces two major theoretical obstacles: (1) unlike adaptations favored by simple directional selection, adaptations whose fixation requires some genetic drift are often prevented from spreading by barriers to gene flow; and (2) it is difficult to assemble complex adaptations whose constituent parts arise via peak shifts in different demes. Our review of the data from nature shows that although there is some evidence for individual phases of the shifting balance process, there are few empirical observations explained better by Wright's three-phase mechanism than by simple mass selection. Similarly, artificial selection experiments fail to show that selection in subdivided populations produces greater response than does mass selection in large populations. The complexity of the shifting balance process and the difficulty of establishing that adaptive valleys have been crossed by genetic drift make it impossible to test Wright's claim that adaptations commonly originate by this process. In view of these problems, it seems unreasonable to consider the shifting balance process as an important explanation for the evolution of adaptations.{$]$}},

@article{Wade98,
	Abstract = {{$[$}We critically review the two major theories of adaptive evolution developed early in this century, Wright's shifting balance theory and Fisher's large population size theory, in light of novel findings from field observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical research conducted over the past 15 years. Ecological studies of metapopulations have established that the processes of local extinction and colonization of demes are relatively common in natural populations of many species and theoretical population genetic models have shown that these ecological processes have genetic consequences within and among local demes. Within demes, random genetic drift converts nonadditive genetic variance into additive genetic variance, increasing, rather than limiting, the potential for adaptation to local environments. For this reason, the genetic differences that arise by drift among demes, can be augmented by local selection. The resulting adaptive differences in gene combinations potentially contribute to the genetic origin of new species. These and other recent findings were not discussed by either Wright or Fisher. For example, although Wright emphasized epistatic genetic variance, he did not discuss the conversion process. Similarly, Fisher did not discuss how the average additive effect of a gene varies among demes across a metapopulation whenever there is epistasis. We discuss the implications of such recent findings for the Wright-Fisher controversy and identify some critical open questions that require additional empirical and theoretical study.{$]$}},

@article{Hauert04,
	Abstract = {Understanding the emergence of cooperation is a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology1. Evolutionary game theory2,3 has become a powerful framework with which to investigate this problem. Two simple games have attracted most attention in theoretical and experimental studies: the Prisoner's Dilemma4 and the snowdrift game (also known as the hawk--dove or chicken game)5. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the non-cooperative state is evolutionarily stable, which has inspired numerous investigations of suitable extensions that enable cooperative behaviour to persist. In particular, on the basis of spatial extensions of the Prisoner's Dilemma, it is widely accepted that spatial structure promotes the evolution of cooperation6,7,8. Here we show that no such general predictions can be made for the effects of spatial structure in the snowdrift game. In unstructured snowdrift games, intermediate levels of cooperation persist. Unexpectedly, spatial structure reduces the proportion of cooperators for a wide range of parameters. In particular, spatial structure eliminates cooperation if the cost-to-benefit ratio of cooperation is high. Our results caution against the common belief that spatial structure is necessarily beneficial for cooperative behaviour.},

We show instead that genetic variation data in humans and gibbons as well as in Old World monkeys are inconsistent with a model of convergent evolution and support the hypothesis of an ancient, multiallelic polymorphism of which some alleles are shared by descent among species. These results demonstrate that the A and B blood groups result from a trans-species polymorphism among distantly related species and has remained under balancing selection for tens of millions of years---to date, the only such example in hominoids and Old World monkeys outside of the major histocompatibility complex.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of organismality is a social process. All organisms originated from groups of simpler units that now show high cooperation among the parts and are nearly free of conflicts. We suggest that this near-unanimous cooperation be taken as the defining trait of organisms. Consistency then requires that we accept some unconventional organisms, including some social insect colonies, some microbial groups and viruses, a few sexual partnerships and a number of mutualistic associations. Whether we call these organisms or not, a major task is to explain such cooperative entities, and our survey suggests that many of the traits commonly used to define organisms are not essential. These non-essential traits include physical contiguity, indivisibility, clonality or high relatedness, development from a single cell, short-term and long-term genetic cotransmission, germ-soma separation and membership in the same species.},

@article{Folse10,
	Abstract = {Most biologists implicitly define an individual organism as "one genome in one body." This definition is based on physiological and genetic criteria, but it is problematic for colonial organisms. We propose a definition based instead on the evolutionary criteria of alignment of fitness, export of fitness by germ-soma specialization, and adaptive functional organization. We consider how these concepts apply to various putative individual organisms. We conclude that complex multicellular organisms and colonies of eusocial insects satisfy these three criteria, but that, in most cases (with at least one notable exception), colonies of modular organisms and genetic chimeras do not. While species do not meet these criteria, they may meet the criteria for a broader concept--that of an evolutionary individual--and sexual reproduction may be a species-level exaptation for enhancing evolvability. We also review the costs and benefits of internal genetic heterogeneity within putative individuals, demonstrating that high relatedness is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for individuality, and that, in some cases, genetic variability may have adaptive benefits at the level of the whole.},

	Abstract = {What changes when an evolutionary transition in individuality takes place? Many different answers have been given, in respect of different cases of actual transition, but some have suggested a general answer: that a major transition is a change in the extent to which selection acts at one hierarchical level rather than another. The current paper evaluates some different ways to develop this general answer as a way to characterise the property `evolutionary individuality'; and offers a justification of the option taken in Clarke (J Philos 110(8):413--435, 2013)---to define evolutionary individuality in terms of an object's capacity to undergo selection at its own level. In addition, I suggest a method by which the property can be measured and argue that a problem which is often considered to be fatal to that method---the problem of `cross-level by-products'---can be avoided.},

	Abstract = {The organism is one of the fundamental concepts of biology and has been at the center of many discussions about biological individuality, yet what exactly it is can be confusing. The definition that we find generally useful is that an organism is a unit in which all the subunits have evolved to be highly cooperative, with very little conflict. We focus on how often organisms evolve from two or more formerly independent organisms. Two canonical transitions of this type---replicators clustered in cells and endosymbiotic organelles within host cells---demonstrate the reality of this kind of evolutionary transition and suggest conditions that can favor it. These conditions include co-transmission of the partners across generations and rules that strongly regulate and limit conflict, such as a fair meiosis. Recently, much attention has been given to associations of animals with microbes involved in their nutrition. These range from tight endosymbiotic associations like those between aphids and Buchnera bacteria, to the complex communities in animal intestines. Here, starting with a reflection about identity through time (which we call ``Theseus's fish''), we consider the distinctions between these kinds of animal--bacteria interactions and describe the criteria by which a few can be considered jointly organismal but most cannot.},

Such characterization involves the simultaneous holding of genetic uniqueness, genetic homogeneity and autonomy, which in turn are considered invariant attributes. Data accumulated over the past 15 years, however, indicate that all three characters can independently be present or absent in different types of multicellular organism. Combining their respective presence or absence leads to recognizing different kinds of individual; a realization that has ecological and evolutionary implications.},

@article{Hallstrom10,
	Abstract = {The massive amount of genomic sequence data that is now available for analyzing evolutionary relationships among 31 placental mammals reduces the stochastic error in phylogenetic analyses to virtually zero. One would expect that this would make it possible to finally resolve controversial branches in the placental mammalian tree. We analyzed a 2,863,797 nucleotide-long alignment (3,364 genes) from 31 placental mammals for reconstructing their evolution. Most placental mammalian relationships were resolved, and a consensus of their evolution is emerging. However, certain branches remain difficult or virtually impossible to resolve. These branches are characterized by short divergence times in the order of 1--4 million years. Computer simulations based on parameters from the real data show that as little as about 12,500 amino acid sites could be sufficient to confidently resolve short branches as old as about 90 million years ago (Ma). Thus, the amount of sequence data should no longer be a limiting factor in resolving the relationships among placental mammals. The timing of the early radiation of placental mammals coincides with a period of climate warming some 100--80 Ma and with continental fragmentation. These global processes may have triggered the rapid diversification of placental mammals. However, the rapid radiations of certain mammalian groups complicate phylogenetic analyses, possibly due to incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. These speciation-related processes led to a mosaic genome and conflicting phylogenetic signals. Split network methods are ideal for visualizing these problematic branches and can therefore depict data conflict and possibly the true evolutionary history better than strictly bifurcating trees. Given the timing of tectonics, of placental mammalian divergences, and the fossil record, a Laurasian rather than Gondwanan origin of placental mammals seems the most parsimonious explanation.},

@article{Vaux16,
	Abstract = {Using the framework of evolutionary lineages to separate the process of evolution and classification of species, we observe that `anagenesis'and `cladogenesis'are unnecessary terms. The terms have changed significantly in meaning over time, and current usage is inconsistent and vague across many different disciplines. The most popular definition of cladogenesis is the splitting of evolutionary lineages (cessation of gene flow), whereas anagenesis is evolutionary change between splits. Cladogenesis (and lineage-splitting) is also regularly made synonymous with speciation. This definition is misleading as lineage-splitting is prolific during evolution and because palaeontological studies provide no direct estimate of gene flow. The terms also fail to incorporate speciation without being arbitrary or relative, and the focus upon lineage-splitting ignores the importance of divergence, hybridization, extinction and informative value (i.e. what is helpful to describe as a taxon) for species classification. We conclude and demonstrate that evolution and species diversity can be considered with greater clarity using simpler, more transparent terms than anagenesis and cladogenesis. Describing evolution and taxonomic classification can be straightforward, and there is no need to `make words mean so many different things'.},

	Abstract = {It is unclear why sexually reproducing isogamous species frequently contain just two self-incompatible mating types. Deterministic theory suggests that since rare novel mating types experience a selective advantage (by virtue of their many potential partners), the number of mating types should consistently grow. However, in nature, species with thousands of mating types are exceedingly rare. Several competing theories for the predominance of species with two mating types exist, yet they lack an explanation for how many are possible and in which species to expect high numbers. Here, we present a theoretical null model that explains the distribution of mating type numbers using just three biological parameters: mutation rate, population size and the rate of sex. If the number of mating types results from a mutation--extinction balance, the rate of sexual reproduction plays a crucial role. If sex is facultative and rare (a very common combination in isogamous species), mating type diversity will remain low. In this rare sex regime, small fitness differences between the mating types lead to more frequent extinctions, further lowering mating type diversity. We also show that the empirical literature supports the role of drift and facultativeness of sex as a determinant of mating type dynamics.},

	N2 = {Cyanobacteria are among the most diverse prokaryotic phyla, with morphotypes ranging from unicellular to multicellular filamentous forms, including those able to terminally (i.e., irreversibly) differentiate in form and function. It has been suggested that cyanobacteria raised oxygen levels in the atmosphere around 2.45--2.32 billion y ago during the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), hence dramatically changing life on the planet. However, little is known about the temporal evolution of cyanobacterial lineages, and possible interplay between the origin of multicellularity, diversification of cyanobacteria, and the rise of atmospheric oxygen. We estimated divergence times of extant cyanobacterial lineages under Bayesian relaxed clocks for a dataset of 16S rRNA sequences representing the entire known diversity of this phylum. We tested whether the evolution of multicellularity overlaps with the GOE, and whether multicellularity is associated with significant shifts in diversification rates in cyanobacteria. Our results indicate an origin of cyanobacteria before the rise of atmospheric oxygen. The evolution of multicellular forms coincides with the onset of the GOE and an increase in diversification rates. These results suggest that multicellularity could have played a key role in triggering cyanobacterial evolution around the GOE.},

	Abstract = {The last 3.85 Gyr of Earth history have been divided into five stages. During stage 1 (3.85-2.45 Gyr ago (Ga)) the atmosphere was largely or entirely anoxic, as were the oceans, with the possible exception of oxygen oases in the shallow oceans. During stage 2 (2.45-1.85 Ga) atmospheric oxygen levels rose to values estimated to have been between 0.02 and 0.04 atm. The shallow oceans became mildly oxygenated, while the deep oceans continued anoxic. Stage 3 (1.85-0.85 Ga) was apparently rather 'boring'. Atmospheric oxygen levels did not change significantly. Most of the surface oceans were mildly oxygenated, as were the deep oceans. Stage 4 (0.85-0.54 Ga) saw a rise in atmospheric oxygen to values not much less than 0.2 atm. The shallow oceans followed suit, but the deep oceans were anoxic, at least during the intense Neoproterozoic ice ages. Atmospheric oxygen levels during stage 5 (0.54 Ga-present) probably rose to a maximum value of ca 0.3 atm during the Carboniferous before returning to its present value. The shallow oceans were oxygenated, while the oxygenation of the deep oceans fluctuated considerably, perhaps on rather geologically short time-scales.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pattern and timing of the rise in complex multicellular life during Earth's history has not been established. Great disparity persists between the pattern suggested by the fossil record and that estimated by molecular clocks, especially for plants, animals, fungi, and the deepest branches of the eukaryote tree. Here, we used all available protein sequence data and molecular clock methods to place constraints on the increase in complexity through time. RESULTS: Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that (i) animals are more closely related to fungi than to plants, (ii) red algae are closer to plants than to animals or fungi, (iii) choanoflagellates are closer to animals than to fungi or plants, (iv) diplomonads, euglenozoans, and alveolates each are basal to plants+animals+fungi, and (v) diplomonads are basal to other eukaryotes (including alveolates and euglenozoans). Divergence times were estimated from global and local clock methods using 20-188 proteins per node, with data treated separately (multigene) and concatenated (supergene). Different time estimation methods yielded similar results (within 5%): vertebrate-arthropod (964 million years ago, Ma), Cnidaria-Bilateria (1,298 Ma), Porifera-Eumetozoa (1,351 Ma), Pyrenomycetes-Plectomycetes (551 Ma), Candida-Saccharomyces (723 Ma), Hemiascomycetes-filamentous Ascomycota (982 Ma), Basidiomycota-Ascomycota (968 Ma), Mucorales-Basidiomycota (947 Ma), Fungi-Animalia (1,513 Ma), mosses-vascular plants (707 Ma), Chlorophyta-Tracheophyta (968 Ma), Rhodophyta-Chlorophyta+Embryophyta (1,428 Ma), Plantae-Animalia (1,609 Ma), Alveolata-plants+animals+fungi (1,973 Ma), Euglenozoa-plants+animals+fungi (1,961 Ma), and Giardia-plants+animals+fungi (2,309 Ma). By extrapolation, mitochondria arose approximately 2300-1800 Ma and plastids arose 1600-1500 Ma. Estimates of the maximum number of cell types of common ancestors, combined with divergence times, showed an increase from two cell types at 2500 Ma to approximately 10 types at 1500 Ma and 50 cell types at approximately 1000 Ma. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that oxygen levels in the environment, and the ability of eukaryotes to extract energy from oxygen, as well as produce oxygen, were key factors in the rise of complex multicellular life. Mitochondria and organisms with more than 2-3 cell types appeared soon after the initial increase in oxygen levels at 2300 Ma. The addition of plastids at 1500 Ma, allowing eukaryotes to produce oxygen, preceded the major rise in complexity.},

@article{Pincheira-Donoso15,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adaptive radiation theory posits that ecological opportunity promotes rapid proliferation of phylogenetic and ecological diversity. Given that adaptive radiation proceeds via occupation of available niche space in newly accessed ecological zones, theory predicts that: (i) evolutionary diversification follows an 'early-burst' process, i.e., it accelerates early in the history of a clade (when available niche space facilitates speciation), and subsequently slows down as niche space becomes saturated by new species; and (ii) phylogenetic branching is accompanied by diversification of ecologically relevant phenotypic traits among newly evolving species. Here, we employ macroevolutionary phylogenetic model-selection analyses to address these two predictions about evolutionary diversification using one of the most exceptionally species-rich and ecologically diverse lineages of living vertebrates, the South American lizard genus Liolaemus. RESULTS: Our phylogenetic analyses lend support to a density-dependent lineage diversification model. However, the lineage through-time diversification curve does not provide strong support for an early burst. In contrast, the evolution of phenotypic (body size) relative disparity is high, significantly different from a Brownian model during approximately the last 5 million years of Liolaemus evolution. Model-fitting analyses also reject the 'early-burst' model of phenotypic evolution, and instead favour stabilizing selection (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, with three peaks identified) as the best model for body size diversification. Finally, diversification rates tend to increase with smaller body size. CONCLUSIONS: Liolaemus have diversified under a density-dependent process with slightly pronounced apparent episodic pulses of lineage accumulation, which are compatible with the expected episodic ecological opportunity created by gradual uplifts of the Andes over the last ~25My. We argue that ecological opportunity can be strong and a crucial driver of adaptive radiations in continents, but may emerge less frequently (compared to islands) when major events (e.g., climatic, geographic) significantly modify environments. In contrast, body size diversification conforms to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model with multiple trait optima. Despite this asymmetric diversification between both lineages and phenotype, links are expected to exist between the two processes, as shown by our trait-dependent analyses of diversification. We finally suggest that the definition of adaptive radiation should not be conditioned by the existence of early-bursts of diversification, and should instead be generalized to lineages in which species and ecological diversity have evolved from a single ancestor.},

The parameters for a large and representative class of proteins are determined using experimental measures. The main important and surprising conclusion of our study is to show that despite the significant fluctuations of free RNA polymerases and free ribosomes, they bring little variability to protein production contrary to what has been previously proposed in the literature. After verifying the robustness of this quite counter-intuitive result, we discuss its possible origin from a theoretical view, and interpret it as the result of a mean-field effect.},

Most studies have been performed on large cell populations, but detailed understanding of cell dynamics and heterogeneity requires single-cell analysis. Here, we used quantitative real-time PCR, profiling the expression of 93 genes in single-cells from three different cell lines. Individual unsynchronized cells from three different cell lines were collected in different cell cycle phases (G0/G1 --S --G2/M) with variable cell sizes. We found that the total transcript level per cell and the expression of most individual genes correlated with progression through the cell cycle, but not with cell size. By applying the random forests algorithm, a supervised machine learning approach, we show how a multi-gene signature that classifies individual cells into their correct cell cycle phase and cell size can be generated. To identify the most predictive genes we used a variable selection strategy. Detailed analysis of cell cycle predictive genes allowed us to define subpopulations with distinct gene expression profiles and to calculate a cell cycle index that illustrates the transition of cells between cell cycle phases. In conclusion, we provide useful experimental approaches and bioinformatics to identify informative and predictive genes at the single-cell level, which opens up new means to describe and understand cell proliferation and subpopulation dynamics.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental question in biology is the following: what is the time scale that is needed for evolutionary innovations? There are many results that characterize single steps in terms of the fixation time of new mutants arising in populations of certain size and structure. But here we ask a different question, which is concerned with the much longer time scale of evolutionary trajectories: how long does it take for a population exploring a fitness landscape to find target sequences that encode new biological functions? Our key variable is the length, L, of the genetic sequence that undergoes adaptation. In computer science there is a crucial distinction between problems that require algorithms which take polynomial or exponential time. The latter are considered to be intractable. Here we develop a theoretical approach that allows us to estimate the time of evolution as function of L. We show that adaptation on many fitness landscapes takes time that is exponential in L, even if there are broad selection gradients and many targets uniformly distributed in sequence space. These negative results lead us to search for specific mechanisms that allow evolution to work on polynomial time scales. We study a regeneration process and show that it enables evolution to work in polynomial time.},

	Abstract = {Functional proteins within cells are normally present in their native, completely folded form. However, vital processes of protein biogenesis such as protein synthesis and translocation of proteins into intracellular compartments require the protein to exist temporarily in an unfolded or partially folded conformation. As a consequence, regions buried when a polypeptide is in its native conformation become exposed and interact with other proteins causing protein aggregation which is deleterious to the cell. To prevent aggregation as proteins become unfolded, heat-shock proteins protect these interactive surfaces by binding to them and facilitating the folding of unfolded or nascent polypeptides. In other instances the binding of heat-shock proteins to interactive surfaces of completely folded proteins is a crucial part of their regulation. As heat shock and other stress conditions cause cellular proteins to become partially unfolded, the ability of heat-shock proteins to protect cells against the adverse effects of stress becomes a logical extension of their normal function as molecular chaperones.},

This timescale implies an early establishment of terrestrial ecosystems by land plants that is in close accord with recent estimates for the origin of terrestrial animal lineages. Biogeochemical models that are constrained by the fossil record of early land plants, or attempt to explain their impact, must consider a much earlier, middle Cambrian--Early Ordovician, origin.Establishing the timescale of early land plant evolution is essential for testing hypotheses on the coevolution of land plants and Earth's System. The sparseness of early land plant megafossils and stratigraphic controls on their distribution make the fossil record an unreliable guide, leaving only the molecular clock. However, the application of molecular clock methodology is challenged by the current impasse in attempts to resolve the evolutionary relationships among the living bryophytes and tracheophytes. Here, we establish a timescale for early land plant evolution that integrates over topological uncertainty by exploring the impact of competing hypotheses on bryophyte−tracheophyte relationships, among other variables, on divergence time estimation. We codify 37 fossil calibrations for Viridiplantae following best practice. We apply these calibrations in a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analysis of a phylogenomic dataset encompassing the diversity of Embryophyta and their relatives within Viridiplantae. Topology and dataset sizes have little impact on age estimates, with greater differences among alternative clock models and calibration strategies. For all analyses, a Cambrian origin of Embryophyta is recovered with highest probability. The estimated ages for crown tracheophytes range from Late Ordovician to late Silurian. This timescale implies an early establishment of terrestrial ecosystems by land plants that is in close accord with recent estimates for the origin of terrestrial animal lineages. Biogeochemical models that are constrained by the fossil record of early land plants, or attempt to explain their impact, must consider the implications of a much earlier, middle Cambrian--Early Ordovician, origin.},

@article{Pisani04,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The earliest fossil evidence of terrestrial animal activity is from the Ordovician, approximately 450 million years ago (Ma). However, there are earlier animal fossils, and most molecular clocks suggest a deep origin of animal phyla in the Precambrian, leaving open the possibility that animals colonized land much earlier than the Ordovician. To further investigate the time of colonization of land by animals, we sequenced two nuclear genes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and enolase, in representative arthropods and conducted phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses of those and other available DNA and protein sequence data. To assess the robustness of animal molecular clocks, we estimated the deuterostome-arthropod divergence using the arthropod fossil record for calibration and tunicate instead of vertebrate sequences to represent Deuterostomia. Nine nuclear and 15 mitochondrial genes were used in phylogenetic analyses and 61 genes were used in molecular clock analyses. RESULTS: Significant support was found for the unconventional pairing of myriapods (millipedes and centipedes) with chelicerates (spiders, scorpions, horseshoe crabs, etc.) using nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Our estimated time for the divergence of millipedes (Diplopoda) and centipedes (Chilopoda) was 442 +/- 50 Ma, and the divergence of insects and crustaceans was estimated as 666 +/- 58 Ma. Our results also agree with previous studies suggesting a deep divergence (approximately 1100 - 900 Ma) for arthropods and deuterostomes, considerably predating the Cambrian Explosion seen in the animal fossil record. CONCLUSIONS: The consistent support for a close relationship between myriapods and chelicerates, using mitochondrial and nuclear genes and different methods of analysis, suggests that this unexpected result is not an artefact of analysis. We propose the name Myriochelata for this group of animals, which includes many that immobilize prey with venom. Our molecular clock analyses using arthropod fossil calibrations support earlier studies using vertebrate calibrations in finding that deuterostomes and arthropods diverged hundreds of millions of years before the Cambrian explosion. However, our molecular time estimate for the divergence of millipedes and centipedes is close to the divergence time inferred from fossils. This suggests that arthropods may have adapted to the terrestrial environment relatively late in their evolutionary history.},

	Abstract = {One of the important unanswered questions in evolutionary biology is how evolutionary innovations originate. Recent advances in evolutionary developmental biology and genomics have put the developmental, mechanistic aspects of evolutionary change into the hands of evolutionary biologists and we now have the means to acquire an experimentally grounded understanding of this important phenomenon. In addition to the technical advances the field requires clarity about the research agenda: what is it that we need to know in order to understand evolutionary novelties and innovations? One critical insight is that the vernacular notion of ``innovation''covers at least three distinct phenomena: the evolution of a novel functional capacity, the origin of a novel body part (type I novelty), and the radical transformation of a pre-existing body part (type II novelty). Here I argue that these three phenomena are the result of different kinds of biological processes and thus require different research approaches to be addressed. For the origin of novel body parts a research agenda is outlined based on the hypothesis that body part identity is constituted by the activity of a core gene regulatory network that mediates between positional information signals and so-called realizer genes. Under this perspective the origin of a novel body part or cell type is identical with the origin of a novel core gene regulatory network that endows the novel body part with developmental and variational individuality. Technical approaches to investigate the origin of novel core regulatory networks are briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the formation of cratons and orogenic belts is critical to the modelling of supercontinental assemblies. Continental cratons began to assemble by 3000 Ma or possibly earlier. The oldest assembly, Ur, was followed by Arctica at ∼2500 Ma and Atlantica at ∼2000 Ma. These three continental blocks apparently remained coherent until the breakup of Pangea. Nearly all of earth's continental blocks were assembled into one large landmass during at least three times in earth history. The oldest assembly comparable in size to Pangea was probably Columbia, which formed at ∼1800 Ma and began to rift at ∼1500 Ma. Columbia was followed by Rodinia, which lasted from ∼1100 Ma to 700 Ma. East and West Gondwana combined to form Gondwana at ∼500 Ma, and it joined with Laurasia to form Pangea at ∼250 Ma.},

	Abstract = {{$[$}The floor of the Indian Ocean is dominated by (1) the scismically active Mid-Oceanic Ridge, (2) scattered linear micro-continents (mostly meridional), and (3) fracture zones (some displace the axis of the Mid-Oceanic Ridge and others parallel the micro-continents). The pattern suggests that movement along the Diamantina Fracture Zone has displaced Australia to the cast relative to Broken Ridge. In the Arabian Sea north-northeast trending fracture zones have displaced the axis of the Carlsberg Ridge. The complex tectonic fabric of the Indian Ocean is difficult to explain in terms of a simple pattern of convection currents. The location and origin of the Mid-Oceanic Ridge, of oceanic rises, aseismic ridges and transcurrent fault systems must be accounted for in any hypothesis of continental displacement despite unique or exotic assumptions as to strength, viscosity or composition of the oceanic crust and mantle.{$]$}},

	Abstract = {{$[$}Recent work has determined the depth of the Mohorovi{\v c}i{\'c}discontinuity at sea and has made it likely that peridotite xenoliths in basaltic volcanic rocks are samples of material from below the discontinuity. It is now possible to produce a hypothetical section showing the transition from a continent to an ocean. This section is consistent with both the seismic and gravity results. The possible reactions of the crust to changes in the total volume of sea water are discussed. It seems possible that the oceans were shallower and the crust thinner in the Archean than they are now. If this were so, some features of the oldest rocks of Canada and Southern Rhodesia could be explained. Three processes are described that might lead to the formation of oceanic ridges; one of these involves tension, one compression and the other quiet tectonic conditions. It is likely that not all ridges are formed in the same way. It is possible that serpentization of olivine by water rising from the interior of the earth plays an important part in producing changes of level in the ocean floor and anomalies in heat flow. Finally, a method of reducing gravity observations at sea is discussed.{$]$}},

However, it was not known how biotic interchange develops over longer time periods of several million years following the secondary contact of different biotas. Here we present a novel method to investigate the temporal dynamics of biotic interchange based on a phylogeographical meta-analysis by calculating the maximal number of observed dispersal events per million years given the temporal uncertainty of the underlying time-calibrated phylogenies. We show that biotic influx from mainland Asia onto the Indian subcontinent after Eocene continental collision was not a uniform process, but was subject to periods of acceleration, stagnancy and decrease. We discuss potential palaeoenvironmental causes for this fluctuation.},

	N2 = {The older eastern Gal{\'a}pagos are different in almost every way from the historically active western Gal{\'a}pagos volcanoes. Geochemical, geologic, and geophysical data support the hypothesis that the differences are not evolutionary, but rather the eastern volcanoes grew in a different tectonic environment than the younger volcanoes. The western Gal{\'a}pagos volcanoes have steep upper slopes and are topped by large calderas, whereas none of the older islands has a caldera, an observation that is supported by recent gravity measurements. Most of the western volcanoes erupt evolved basalts with an exceedingly small range of Mg{\#}, La$_{n}$/Sm$_{n}$, and Sm$_{n}$/Yb$_{n}$. This is attributed to homogenization in a crustal-scale magmatic mush column, which is maintained in a thermochemical steady state, owing to high magma supply directly over the Gal{\'a}pagos mantle plume. In contrast, the eastern volcanoes erupt relatively primitive magmas, with a large range in Mg{\#}, La$_{n}$/Sm$_{n}$, and Sm$_{n}$/Yb$_{n}$. These differences are attributed to isolated, ephemeral magmatic plumbing systems supplied by smaller magmatic fluxes throughout their histories. Consequently, each batch of magma follows an independent course of evolution, owing to the low volume of supersolidus material beneath these volcanoes. The magmatic flux to Gal{\'a}pagos volcanoes negatively correlates to the distance to the Gal{\'a}pagos Spreading Center (GSC). When the ridge was close to the plume, most of the plume-derived magma was directed to the ridge. Currently, the active volcanoes are much farther from the GSC, thus most of the plume-derived magma erupts on the Nazca Plate and can be focused beneath the large young shields. We define an intermediate sub-province comprising Rabida, Santiago, and Pinzon volcanoes, which were most active about 1 Ma. They have all erupted dacites, rhyolites, and trachytes, similar to the dying stage of the western volcanoes, indicating that there was a relatively large volume of mush beneath them. The paradigm established by the evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes as they are carried away from the hotspot does not apply to most archipelagos.},

@article{Webb91,
	Abstract = {When the isthmian land bridge triggered the Great American Interchange, a large majority of land-mammal families crossed reciprocally between North and South America at about 2.5 Ma (i.e., Late Pliocene). Initially land-mammal dynamics proceeded as predicted by equilibrium theory, with roughly equal reciprocal mingling on both continents. Also as predicted, the impact of the interchange faded in North America after about 1 m.y. In South America, contrary to such predictions, the interchange became decidedly unbalanced: during the Pleistocene, groups of North American origin continued to diversify at exponential rates. Whereas only about 10{\%} of North American genera are derived from southern immigrants, more than half of the modern mammalian fauna of South America, measured at the generic level, stems from northern immigrants. In addition, extinctions more severely decimated interchange taxa in North America, where six families were lost, than in South America, where only two immigrant families became extinct. This paper presents a two-phase ecogeographic model to explain the asymmetrical results of the land-mammal interchange. During the humid interglacial phase, the tropics were dominated by rain forests, and the principal biotic movement was from Amazonia to Central America and southern Mexico. During the more arid glacial phase, savanna habitats extended broadly right through tropical latitudes. Because the source area in the temperate north was six times as large as that in the south, immigrants from the north outnumbered those from the south. One prediction of this hypothesis is that immigrants from the north generally should reach higher latitudes in South America than the opposing contingent of land-mammal taxa in North America. Another prediction is that successful interchange families from the north should experience much of their phylogenetic diversification in low latitudes of North America before the interchange. Insofar as these predictions can be tested, they appear to be upheld.},

@article{Marshall82,
	Abstract = {{$[$}A reciprocal and apparently symmetrical interchange of land mammals between North and South America began about 3 million years ago, after the appearance of the Panamanian land bridge. The number of families of land mammals in South America rose from 32 before the interchange to 39 after it began, and then back to 35 at present. An equivalent number of families experienced a comparable rise and decline in North America during the same interval. These changes in diversity are predicted by the MacArthur-Wilson species equilibrium theory. The greater number of North American genera (24) initially entering South America than the reverse (12) is predicted by the proportions of reservoir genera on the two continents. However, a later imbalance caused by secondary immigrants (those which evolved from initial immigrants) is not expected from equilibrium theory.{$]$}},

First published in 1876, this two-volume set presents Wallace's findings, and represents a landmark in the study of zoology, evolutionary biology and palaeontology which remains relevant to scholars in these fields today.

As a result, volvocine phylogenies lack concordance depending on the number and/or type of genes (i.e., chloroplast vs nuclear) chosen for phylogenetic inference. While multiple studies suggest that multicellularity evolved only once in the volvocine algae, that each of its three colonial families is monophyletic, and that there have been at least three independent origins of cellular differentiation in the group, other studies call into question one or more of these conclusions.

Here we re-evaluate a mathematical model used previously to study persistence of cross-feeding and conclude that the maintenance of cross-feeding interactions could be favoured for a larger parameter ranges than formerly observed. Strikingly, we also find that large populations of cross-feeders are not necessarily vulnerable to extinction from an initially small number of cheats who receive the benefit of cross-feeding but do not reciprocate in this cooperative interaction. This could explain the widespread cooperative cross-feeding observed in natural populations.},

@article{Sepkoski84,
	Abstract = {A three-phase kinetic model with time-specific perturbations is used to describe large-scale patterns in the diversification of Phanerozoic marine families. The basic model assumes that the Cambrian, Paleozoic, and Modern evolutionary faunas each diversified logistically as a consequence of early exponential growth and of later slowing of growth as the ecosystems became filled; it also assumes interaction among the evolutionary faunas such that expansion of the combined diversities of all three faunas above any single fauna's equilibrium caused that fauna's diversity to begin to decline. This basic model adequately describes the diversification of the evolutionary faunas through the Paleozoic Era as well as the asymmetrical rise and fall of background extinction rates through the entire Phanerozoic. Declines in diversity and changes in faunal dominance associated with mass extinctions can be accommodated in the model with short-term accelerations in extinction rates or declines in equilibria. Such accelerations, or perturbations, cause diversity to decline exponentially and then to rebound sigmoidally following release. The amount of decline is dependent on the magnitude and duration of the perturbation, the timing of the perturbation with respect to the diversification of the system, and the system's initial per-taxon rates of diversification and turnover. When applied to the three-phase model, such perturbations describe the changes in diversity and faunal dominance during and after major mass extinctions, the long-term rise in total diversity following the Late Permian and Norian mass extinctions, and the peculiar diversification and then decline of the remnants of the Paleozoic fauna during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras. The good fit of this model to data on Phanerozoic familial diversity suggests that many of the large-scale patterns of diversification seen in the marine fossil record of animal families are simple consequences of nonlinear interrelationships among a small number of parameters that are intrinsic to the evolutionary faunas and are largely (but not completely) invariant through time.},

The diversification of marine families in the past 600 million years (Myr) appears to have followed two or three logistic curves, with equilibrium levels that lasted for up to 200 Myr. In contrast, continental organisms clearly show an exponential pattern of diversification, and although it is not clear whether the empirical diversification patterns are real or are artefacts of a poor fossil record, the latter explanation seems unlikely. Perhaps marine and continental organisms diversified in different ways, or perhaps the appearance of equilibrium patterns for marine organisms is an artefact of taxonomic structures.},

@article{Sepkoski78,
	Abstract = {A simple equilibrial model for the growth and maintenance of Phanerozoic global marine taxonomic diversity can be constructed from considerations of the behavior of origination and extinction rates with respect to diversity. An initial postulate that total rate of diversification is proportional to number of taxa extant leads to an exponential model for early phases of diversification. This model appears to describe adequately the ``explosive''diversification of known metazoan orders across the Precambrian-Cambrian Boundary, suggesting that no special event, other than the initial appearance of Metazoa, is necessary to explain this phenomenon. As numbers of taxa increase, the rate of diversification should become ``diversity dependent.''Ecological factors should cause the per taxon rate of origination to decline and the per taxon rate of extinction to increase. If these relationships are modeled as simple linear functions, a logistic description of the behavior of taxonomic diversity through time results. This model appears remarkably consistent with the known pattern of Phanerozoic marine ordinal diversity as a whole. Analysis of observed rates of ordinal origination also indicates these are to a large extent diversity dependent; however, diversity dependence is not immediately evident in rates of ordinal extinction. Possible explanations for this pattern are derived from considerations of the size of higher taxa and from simulations of their diversification. These suggest that both the standing diversity and the pattern of origination of orders may adequately reflect the behavior of species diversity through time; however, correspondence between rates of ordinal and species extinction may deteriorate with progressive loss of information resulting from incomplete sampling of the fossil record.},

@article{Briggs17,
	Abstract = {Recently, two articles were published in leading scientific journals, each calling attention to an emerging mass extinction. The two are complementary in that they reached the same conclusion by using data from contrasting environments. But, the important question in each case is, can the beginning of a mass extinction be confidently predicted from the evidence presented? The two articles are the latest of several publications that have stated the Earth is in the beginning of a great extinction episode that will eventually result in the loss of at about 75{\%} of all living species. The most recent extinction of this magnitude occurred at the close of the Cretaceous about 65 million years ago. The new mass extinction prognosis began about 22 years ago and was based on estimates of species extinction, due to human activities, that had reached thousands of species per year. Although such unsupported estimates soon gave way to more realistic approximations based on documented records, the spectre of a mass extinction has remained. However, I have found evidence that human-caused extinctions have amounted to only about 1.5 species per year for the last 500 years and that these losses have probably been equalled or surpassed by species born (speciation) during that time. Without evidence of substantial net species loss, mass extinction becomes a speculation without substance. The world's greatest conservation problem is not species extinction but population decline to the point where many species exist only as remnants of their former abundance.},

We find that extinction threat in the modern oceans is strongly associated with large body size, whereas past extinction events were either nonselective or preferentially removed smaller-bodied taxa. Pelagic animals were victimized more than benthic animals during previous mass extinctions but are not preferentially threatened in the modern ocean. The differential importance of large-bodied animals to ecosystem function portends greater future ecological disruption than that caused by similar levels of taxonomic loss in past mass extinction events.},

This view overlooks the current trends of population declines and extinctions. Using a sample of 27,600 terrestrial vertebrate species, and a more detailed analysis of 177 mammal species, we show the extremely high degree of population decay in vertebrates, even in common ``species of low concern.''Dwindling population sizes and range shrinkages amount to a massive anthropogenic erosion of biodiversity and of the ecosystem services essential to civilization. This ``biological annihilation''underlines the seriousness for humanity of Earth's ongoing sixth mass extinction event.The population extinction pulse we describe here shows, from a quantitative viewpoint, that Earth's sixth mass extinction is more severe than perceived when looking exclusively at species extinctions. Therefore, humanity needs to address anthropogenic population extirpation and decimation immediately. That conclusion is based on analyses of the numbers and degrees of range contraction (indicative of population shrinkage and/or population extinctions according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature) using a sample of 27,600 vertebrate species, and on a more detailed analysis documenting the population extinctions between 1900 and 2015 in 177 mammal species. We find that the rate of population loss in terrestrial vertebrates is extremely high---even in ``species of low concern.''In our sample, comprising nearly half of known vertebrate species, 32{\%} (8,851/27,600) are decreasing; that is, they have decreased in population size and range. In the 177 mammals for which we have detailed data, all have lost 30{\%} or more of their geographic ranges and more than 40{\%} of the species have experienced severe population declines (\&gt;80{\%} range shrinkage). Our data indicate that beyond global species extinctions Earth is experiencing a huge episode of population declines and extirpations, which will have negative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization. We describe this as a ``biological annihilation''to highlight the current magnitude of Earth's ongoing sixth major extinction event.},

	Abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems have been largely regarded as plant-dominated land surfaces, with the earliest records appearing in the early Phanerozoic (<550 Ma). Yet the presence of biological components in pre-Phanerozoic rocks, in habitats as different as soils, peats, ponds, lakes, streams, and dune fields, implies a much earlier type of terrestrial ecosystems. Microbes were abundant by \~{}3,500 Ma ago and surely adapted to live in subaerial conditions in coastal and inland environments, as they do today. This implies enormous capacities for rapid adaptations to changing conditions, which is supported by a suggestive fossil record. Yet, evidence of ``terrestrial''microbes is rare and indirect in comparison with fossils from shallow or deeper marine environments, and its record has been largely overlooked. Consequently, the notion that microbial communities may have formed the earliest land ecosystems has not been widely accepted nor integrated into our general knowledge. Currently, an ample record of shallow marine and lacustrine biota in \~{}3,500 Ma-old deposits, together with evidence of microbial colonization of coastal environments \~{}3,450 Ma ago and indirect geochemical evidence that suggests biological activity in >3,400 Ma-old paleosols endorses the idea that life on land perhaps occurred in parallel with aquatic life back in the Paleoarchean. The rapid adaptations seen in modern terrestrial microbes, their outstanding tolerance to extreme and fluctuating conditions, their early and rapid diversification, and their old fossil record collectively suggest that they constituted the earliest terrestrial ecosystems, at least since the Neoarchean, further succeeding on land and forming a biomass-rich cover with mature soils where plant-dominated ecosystems later evolved. Understanding how life diversified and adapted to non-aquatic conditions from the actualistic and paleontological perspective is critical to understanding the impact of life on the Earth's systems over thousands of millions of years.},

Using this framework, we systematically investigate the effect of promoter architecture, that is, the number, quality and position of transcription factor binding sites, on cell-to-cell variability in transcription levels. We compare architectures resulting in transcriptional activation with those resulting in transcriptional repression. We start from simple activation and repression motifs with a single operator sequence, and explore the parameter regime for which the cell-to-cell variability is maximal. Using the same formalism, we then turn to more complicated architectures with more than one operator. We examine the effect of independent and cooperative binding, as well as the role of DNA mechanics for those architectures where DNA looping is relevant. We examine the interplay between operator strength and operator number, and we make specific predictions for single-cell mRNA-counting experiments with well characterized promoters. This theoretical approach makes it possible to find the statistical response of a population of cells to perturbations in the architecture of the promoter; it can be used to quantitatively test physical models of gene regulation in vivo, and as the basis of a more systematic approach to designing new promoter architectures.},

	Abstract = {Genes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are typically regulated by complex promoters containing multiple binding sites for a variety of transcription factors leading to a specific functional dependence between regulatory inputs and transcriptional outputs. With increasing regularity, the transcriptional outputs from different promoters are being measured in quantitative detail in single-cell experiments thus providing the impetus for the development of quantitative models of transcription. We describe recent progress in developing models of transcriptional regulation that incorporate, to different degrees, the complexity of multi-state promoter dynamics, and its effect on the transcriptional outputs of single cells. The goal of these models is to predict the statistical properties of transcriptional outputs and characterize their variability in time and across a population of cells, as a function of the input concentrations of transcription factors. The interplay between mathematical models of different regulatory mechanisms and quantitative biophysical experiments holds the promise of elucidating the molecular-scale mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in cells, from bacteria to higher eukaryotes.},

Whether and to which extent obligate metabolic interactions can contribute to maintaining the observed bacterial diversity, however, is not known. In this study, we address this question computationally, by simulating populations of six different bacterial strains that differ in their requirement to obtain amino acids from the environment as well as their propensity to release other amino acids. By systematically varying key variables such as the cost of metabolite production, the speed with which metabolites diffuse in the environment, as well as the amino acid availability in the environment, we show that a cooperative exchange of essential amino acids is evolutionary stable over a broad range of biologically realistic conditions. In particular spatially structured environments, such as bacterial biofilms, and moderate costs of metabolite production favored metabolic interactions. Finally, our work identifies obligate metabolic interactions as a powerful ecological mechanism to maintain different bacterial genotypes with microbial communities.},

Recent empirical work has shown that bacterial genotypes can significantly benefit from trading metabolites with other bacteria relative to cells not engaging in such interactions. Here, we will provide a comprehensive overview over the ecological factors and evolutionary mechanisms that have been identified to explain the evolution and maintenance of metabolic mutualisms among microorganisms.

Two theories have been proposed to explain acetate overflow in Escherichia coli --global control of the central metabolism and local control of the acetate pathway --but neither accounts for all observations. Here, we develop a kinetic model of E. coli metabolism that quantitatively accounts for observed behaviours and successfully predicts the response of E. coli to new perturbations. We reconcile these theories and clarify the origin, control, and regulation of the acetate flux. We also find that, in turns, acetate regulates glucose metabolism by coordinating the expression of glycolytic and TCA genes. Acetate should not be considered a wasteful end-product since it is also a co-substrate and a global regulator of glucose metabolism in E. coli. This has broad implications for our understanding of overflow metabolism.},

	Abstract = {Escherichia coli excretes acetate upon growth on fermentable sugars, but the regulation of this production remains elusive. Acetate excretion on excess glucose is thought to be an irreversible process. However, dynamic 13C-metabolic flux analysis revealed a strong bidirectional exchange of acetate between E. coli and its environment. The Pta-AckA pathway was found to be central for both flux directions, while alternative routes (Acs or PoxB) play virtually no role in glucose consumption. Kinetic modelling of the Pta-AckA pathway predicted that its flux is thermodynamically controlled by the extracellular acetate concentration in vivo. Experimental validations confirmed that acetate production can be reduced and even reversed depending solely on its extracellular concentration. Consistently, the Pta-AckA pathway can rapidly switch from acetate production to consumption. Contrary to current knowledge, E. coli is thus able to co-consume glucose and acetate under glucose excess. These metabolic capabilities were confirmed on other glycolytic substrates which support the growth of E. coli in the gut. These findings highlight the dual role of the Pta-AckA pathway in acetate production and consumption during growth on glycolytic substrates, uncover a novel regulatory mechanism that controls its flux in vivo, and significantly expand the metabolic capabilities of E. coli.},

	Abstract = {Metabolic specialization is a general biological principle that shapes the assembly of microbial communities. Individual cell types rarely metabolize a wide range of substrates within their environment. Instead, different cell types often specialize at metabolizing only subsets of the available substrates. What is the advantage of metabolizing subsets of the available substrates rather than all of them? In this perspective piece, we argue that biochemical conflicts between different metabolic processes can promote metabolic specialization and that a better understanding of these conflicts is therefore important for revealing the general principles and rules that govern the assembly of microbial communities. We first discuss three types of biochemical conflicts that could promote metabolic specialization. Next, we demonstrate how knowledge about the consequences of biochemical conflicts can be used to predict whether different metabolic processes are likely to be performed by the same cell type or by different cell types. We then discuss the major challenges in identifying and assessing biochemical conflicts between different metabolic processes and propose several approaches for their measurement. Finally, we argue that a deeper understanding of the biochemical causes of metabolic specialization could serve as a foundation for the field of synthetic ecology, where the objective would be to rationally engineer the assembly of a microbial community to perform a desired biotransformation.},

Differentiating cladogenesis from anagenesis, defined as evolution within a species, has generally been hampered by dating precision, insufficient fossil data, and difficulties in establishing a direct link between morphological changes detectable in the fossil record and biological species. Here we quantify the relative frequencies of cladogenesis and anagenesis for macroperforate planktic Foraminifera, which arguably have the most complete fossil record currently available, to address this question. Analyzing this record in light of molecular evidence, while taking into account the precision of fossil dating techniques, we estimate that the fraction of speciation events attributable to anagenesis is \&lt;19{\%} during the Cenozoic era (last 65 Myr) and \&lt;10{\%} during the Neogene period (last 23 Myr). Our central conclusion---that cladogenesis is the predominant mode by which new planktic Foraminifera taxa become established at macroevolutionary time scales---differs markedly from the conclusion reached in a recent study based solely on fossil data. These disparate findings demonstrate that interpretations of macroevolutionary dynamics in the fossil record can be fundamentally altered in light of genetic evidence.},

	N2 = {About 8{\%} of our genome is composed of sequences with viral origin, namely human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs). HERVs are relics of ancient infections that affected the primates' germ line along the last 100 million of years, and became stable elements at the interface between self and foreign DNA. Intriguingly, HERV co-evolution with the host led to the domestication of activities previously devoted to the retrovirus life cycle, providing novel cellular functions. For example, selected HERV envelope proteins have been coopted for pregnancy-related purposes, and proviral Long Terminal Repeats participate in the transcriptional regulation of various cellular genes. Given the HERV persistence in the host genome and its basal expression in most healthy tissues, it is reasonable that human defenses should prevent HERV-mediated immune activation. Despite this, HERVs and their products (including RNA, cytosolic DNA, and proteins) are still able to modulate and be influenced by the host immune system, fascinatingly suggesting a central role in the evolution and functioning of the human innate immunity. Indeed, HERV sequences had been major contributors in shaping and expanding the interferon network, dispersing inducible genes that have been occasionally domesticated in various mammalian lineages. Also the HERV integration within or near to genes encoding for critical immune factors has been shown to influence their activity, or to be responsible for their polymorphic variation in the human population, such as in the case of an HERV-K(HML10) provirus in the major histocompatibility complex region. In addition, HERV expressed products have been shown to modulate innate immunity effectors, being therefore often related on the one side to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, while on the other side to the control of excessive immune activation through their immunosuppressive properties. Finally, HERVs have been proposed to establish a protective effect against exogenous infections. The present review summarizes the involvement of HERVs and their products in innate immune responses, describing how their intricate interplay with the first line of human defenses can actively contribute either to the host protection or to his damage, implying a subtle balance between the persistence of HERV expression and the maintenance of a basal immune alert.},

	Abstract = {Many mammalian viruses have acquired genes from their hosts during their evolution. The rationale for these acquisitions is usually quite clear: the captured genes are subverted to provide a selective advantage to the virus. Here we describe the opposite situation, where a viral gene has been sequestered to serve an important function in the physiology of a mammalian host. This gene, encoding a protein that we have called syncytin, is the envelope gene of a recently identified human endogenous defective retrovirus, HERV-W. We find that the major sites of syncytin expression are placental syncytiotrophoblasts, multinucleated cells that originate from fetal trophoblasts. We show that expression of recombinant syncytin in a wide variety of cell types induces the formation of giant syncytia, and that fusion of a human trophoblastic cell line expressing endogenous syncytin can be inhibited by an anti-syncytin antiserum. Our data indicate that syncytin may mediate placental cytotrophoblast fusion in vivo, and thus may be important in human placental morphogenesis.},

	Abstract = {The co-option of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) is increasingly recognized as a recurrent theme in placental biology, which has far-reaching implications for our understanding of mammalian evolution and reproductive health. Most research in this area has focused on ERV-derived proteins, which have been repeatedly co-opted to promote cell-cell fusion and immune modulation in the placenta. ERVs also harbor regulatory sequences that can potentially control placental gene expression, but there has been limited evidence to support this role. In a recent study, Dunn-Fletcher and colleagues discover a striking example of an ERV-derived enhancer element that has been co-opted to regulate a gene important for human pregnancy. Using genomic and experimental approaches, they firmly establish that a primate-specific ERV functions as a placenta-specific enhancer for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a hormone linked to the control of birth timing in humans. Their findings implicate an extensive yet understudied role for retroviruses in shaping the evolution of placental gene regulatory networks.},

	Abstract = {Important roles in origin of life (OL) scenarios have been and still are attributed to viruses. Yet the strict dependence of viruses on cells for their multiplication has been widely acknowledged since the first decades of the 20th century. How could viruses play critical roles in the OL if life relies on cellular organization and if viruses are defined as parasites of cells? In other words, how could viruses play a role in the emergence of cellular life if the existence of cells is a prerequisite for the existence of viruses? This paper investigates this issue and describes past and current OL scenarios conferring viruses with important roles, thereby completing the work of historian of science and physician Scott Podolsky who identified three major roles of viruses in past OL scenarios. Some objections raised by present OL scenarios conferring viruses with an important role are discussed. I argue that disagreements concerning the roles of viruses in OL scenarios stem from the different concepts of life and of virus scientists defend. Investigating the roles of viruses in OL scenarios not only helps identifying different ways to define life in the context of OL theorizing. It also offers the opportunity to better understand how viruses could be conceptualized. The relevance of the replication-first versus metabolism-first dichotomy in OL theorizing is briefly discussed.},

@article{Gould77,
	Abstract = {We believe that punctuational change dominates the history of life: evolution is concentrated in very rapid events of speciation (geologically instantaneous, even if tolerably continuous in ecological time). Most species, during their geological history, either do not change in any appreciable way, or else they fluctuate mildly in morphology, with no apparent direction. Phyletic gradualism is very rare and too slow, in any case, to produce the major events of evolution. Evolutionary trends are not the product of slow, directional transformation within lineages; they represent the differential success of certain species within a clade---speciation may be random with respect to the direction of a trend (Wright's rule).As an a priori bias, phyletic gradualism has precluded any fair assessment of evolutionary tempos and modes. It could not be refuted by empirical catalogues constructed in its light because it excluded contrary information as the artificial result of an imperfect fossil record. With the model of punctuated equilibria, an unbiased distribution of evolutionary tempos can be established by treating stasis as data and by recording the pattern of change for all species in an assemblage. This distribution of tempos can lead to strong inferences about modes. If, as we predict, the punctuational tempo is prevalent, then speciation---not phyletic evolution---must be the dominant mode of evolution.We argue that virtually none of the examples brought forward to refute our model can stand as support for phyletic gradualism; many are so weak and ambiguous that they only reflect the persistent bias for gradualism still deeply embedded in paleontological thought. Of the few stronger cases, we concentrate on Gingerich's data for Hyopsodus and argue that it provides an excellent example of species selection under our model. We then review the data of several studies that have supported our model since we published it five years ago. The record of human evolution seems to provide a particularly good example: no gradualism has been detected within any hominid taxon, and many are long-ranging; the trend to larger brains arises from differential success of essentially static taxa. The data of molecular genetics support our assumption that large genetic changes often accompany the process of speciation.Phyletic gradualism was an a priori assertion from the start---it was never ``seen''in the rocks; it expressed the cultural and political biases of 19th century liberalism. Huxley advised Darwin to eschew it as an ``unnecessary difficulty.''We think that it has now become an empirical fallacy. A punctuational view of change may have wide validity at all levels of evolutionary processes. At the very least, it deserves consideration as an alternate way of interpreting the history of life.},

	Abstract = {Finding fundamental organizing principles is the current intellectual front end of systems biology. From a hydrogen atom to the whole cell level, organisms manage massively parallel and massively interactive processes over several orders of magnitude of size. To manage this scale of informational complexity it is natural to expect organizing principles that determine higher order behavior. Currently, there are only hints of such organizing principles but no absolute evidences. Here, we present an approach as old as Mendel that could help uncover fundamental organizing principles in biology. Our approach essentially consists of identifying constants at various levels and weaving them into a hierarchical chassis. As we identify and organize constants, from pair-wise interactions to networks, our understanding of the fundamental principles in biology will improve, leading to a theory in biology.},

	Abstract = {Charles Darwin's experiences in the Gal{\'a}pagos Islands in 1835 helped to guide his thoughts toward a revolutionary theory: that species were not fixed but diversified from their ancestors over many generations, and that the driving mechanism of evolutionary change was natural selection. In this concise, accessible book, Peter and Rosemary Grant explain what we have learned about the origin and evolution of new species through the study of the finches made famous by that great scientist: Darwin's finches.   Drawing upon their unique observations of finch evolution over a thirty-four-year period, the Grants trace the evolutionary history of fourteen different species from a shared ancestor three million years ago. They show how repeated cycles of speciation involved adaptive change through natural selection on beak size and shape, and divergence in songs. They explain other factors that drive finch evolution, including geographical isolation, which has kept the Gal{\'a}pagos relatively free of competitors and predators; climate change and an increase in the number of islands over the last three million years, which enhanced opportunities for speciation; and flexibility in the early learning of feeding skills, which helped species to exploit new food resources. Throughout, the Grants show how the laboratory tools of developmental biology and molecular genetics can be combined with observations and experiments on birds in the field to gain deeper insights into why the world is so biologically rich and diverse.   Written by two preeminent evolutionary biologists, <em>How and Why Species Multiply</em> helps to answer fundamental questions about evolution--in the Gal{\'a}pagos and throughout the world.},

	Abstract = {Interactions between natural selection and environmental change are well recognized and sit at the core of ecology and evolutionary biology. Reciprocal interactions between ecology and evolution, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, are less well studied, even though they may be critical for understanding the evolution of biological diversity, the structure of communities and the function of ecosystems. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks require that populations alter their environment (niche construction) and that those changes in the environment feed back to influence the subsequent evolution of the population. There is strong evidence that organisms influence their environment through predation, nutrient excretion and habitat modification, and that populations evolve in response to changes in their environment at time-scales congruent with ecological change (contemporary evolution). Here, we outline how the niche construction and contemporary evolution interact to alter the direction of evolution and the structure and function of communities and ecosystems. We then present five empirical systems that highlight important characteristics of eco-evolutionary feedbacks: rotifer-algae chemostats; alewife-zooplankton interactions in lakes; guppy life-history evolution and nutrient cycling in streams; avian seed predators and plants; and tree leaf chemistry and soil processes. The alewife-zooplankton system provides the most complete evidence for eco-evolutionary feedbacks, but other systems highlight the potential for eco-evolutionary feedbacks in a wide variety of natural systems.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary ecologists and population biologists have recently considered that ecological and evolutionary changes are intimately linked and can occur on the same time-scale. Recent theoretical developments have shown how the feedback between ecological and evolutionary dynamics can be linked, and there are now empirical demonstrations showing that ecological change can lead to rapid evolutionary change. We also have evidence that microevolutionary change can leave an ecological signature. We are at a stage where the integration of ecology and evolution is a necessary step towards major advances in our understanding of the processes that shape and maintain biodiversity. This special feature about 'eco-evolutionary dynamics' brings together biologists from empirical and theoretical backgrounds to bridge the gap between ecology and evolution and provide a series of contributions aimed at quantifying the interactions between these fundamental processes.},

	Abstract = {Myxozoans are a clade of highly derived cnidarians. The phylogenetic identity of these extremely simplified parasites of aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates had long been uncertain, with all early classifications designating Myxozoa as protists. Though suggestions were frequently made that the infective spores of these parasites are multicellular and possibly of cnidarian origin, it would take a phylogenetic analysis of ultrastructural developmental characters in combination with rRNA gene sequences to verify the Myxozoa as secondarily reduced cnidarians, sister to the polypoidozoan parasite Polypodium hydriforme . While a series of subsequent molecular studies suggested hypotheses of Myxozoa as basal bilaterians, triploblasts, or even nematodes, phylogenomic analyses with improved taxon sampling corroborated the landmark paper that verified the cnidarian nature of this group. This review of the body of phylogenetic work on Myxozoa aims to clarify historical progress and current knowledge, as well as to emphasize the opportune position that myxozoan biologists now are in, to address fundamental questions of cell biology of these parasites as well as the evolution of animal life.},

The methods are the Camin-Sokal parsimony method, the compatibility method, and Farris's unrooted Wagner tree parsimony method. In all cases the conditions for this failure (which is the failure to be statistically consistent) are essentially that parallel changes exceed informative, nonparallel changes. It is possible for these methods to be inconsistent even when change is improbable a priori, provided that evolutionary rates in different lineages are sufficiently unequal.

@article{Lartillot07,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thanks to the large amount of signal contained in genome-wide sequence alignments, phylogenomic analyses are converging towards highly supported trees. However, high statistical support does not imply that the tree is accurate. Systematic errors, such as the Long Branch Attraction (LBA) artefact, can be misleading, in particular when the taxon sampling is poor, or the outgroup is distant. In an otherwise consistent probabilistic framework, systematic errors in genome-wide analyses can be traced back to model mis-specification problems, which suggests that better models of sequence evolution should be devised, that would be more robust to tree reconstruction artefacts, even under the most challenging conditions. METHODS: We focus on a well characterized LBA artefact analyzed in a previous phylogenomic study of the metazoan tree, in which two fast-evolving animal phyla, nematodes and platyhelminths, emerge either at the base of all other Bilateria, or within protostomes, depending on the outgroup. We use this artefactual result as a case study for comparing the robustness of two alternative models: a standard, site-homogeneous model, based on an empirical matrix of amino-acid replacement (WAG), and a site-heterogeneous mixture model (CAT). In parallel, we propose a posterior predictive test, allowing one to measure how well a model acknowledges sequence saturation. RESULTS: Adopting a Bayesian framework, we show that the LBA artefact observed under WAG disappears when the site-heterogeneous model CAT is used. Using cross-validation, we further demonstrate that CAT has a better statistical fit than WAG on this data set. Finally, using our statistical goodness-of-fit test, we show that CAT, but not WAG, correctly accounts for the overall level of saturation, and that this is due to a better estimation of site-specific amino-acid preferences. CONCLUSION: The CAT model appears to be more robust than WAG against LBA artefacts, essentially because it correctly anticipates the high probability of convergences and reversions implied by the small effective size of the amino-acid alphabet at each site of the alignment. More generally, our results provide strong evidence that site-specificities in the substitution process need be accounted for in order to obtain more reliable phylogenetic trees.},

	N2 = {Abstract The history of long-branch attraction, and in particular methods suggested to detect and avoid the artifact to date, is reviewed. Methods suggested to avoid LBA-artifacts include excluding long-branch taxa, excluding faster evolving third codon positions, using inference methods less sensitive to LBA such as likelihood, the Aguinaldo et al. approach, sampling more taxa to break up long branches and sampling more characters especially of another kind, and the pros and cons of these are discussed. Methods suggested to detect LBA are numerous and include methodological disconcordance, RASA, separate partition analyses, parametric simulation, random outgroup sequences, long-branch extraction, split decomposition and spectral analysis. Less than 10 years ago it was doubted if LBA occurred in real datasets. Today, examples are numerous in the literature and it is argued that the development of methods to deal with the problem is warranted. A 16?kbp dataset of placental mammals and a morphological and molecular combined dataset of gall waSPS are used to illustrate the particularly common problem of LBA of problematic ingroup taxa to outgroups. The preferred methods of separate partition analysis, methodological disconcordance, and long branch extraction are used to demonstrate detection methods. It is argued that since outgroup taxa almost always represent long branches and are as such a hazard towards misplacing long branched ingroup taxa, phylogenetic analyses should always be run with and without the outgroups included. This will detect whether only the outgroup roots the ingroup or if it simultaneously alters the ingroup topology, in which case previous studies have shown that the latter is most often the worse. Apart from that LBA to outgroups is the major and most common problem; scanning the literature also detected the ill advised comfort of high support values from thousands of characters, but very few taxa, in the age of genomics. Taxon sampling is crucial for an accurate phylogenetic estimate and trust cannot be put on whole mitochondrial or chloroplast genome studies with only a few taxa, despite their high support values. The placental mammal example demonstrates that parsimony analysis will be prone to LBA by the attraction of the tenrec to the distant marsupial outgroups. In addition, the murid rodents, creating the classic ?the guinea-pig is not a rodent? hypothesis in 1996, are also shown to be attracted to the outgroup by nuclear genes, although including the morphological evidence for rodents and Glires overcomes the artifact. The gall wasp example illustrates that Bayesian analyses with a partition-specific GTR?+?Γ?+ I model give a conflicting resolution of clades, with a posterior probability of 1.0 when comparing ingroup alone versus outgroup rooted topologies, and this is due to long-branch attraction to the outgroup. ?

Here we address this issue by systematically cultivating metabolically dependent strains of different bacterial species either individually or as pairwise cocultures in a wide range of carbon sources. Our results show that obligate cross-feeding is significantly more likely to expand the metabolic niche space of interacting bacterial populations than to contract it. Moreover, niche expansion occurred predominantly between two specialist taxa and correlated positively with the phylogenetic distance between interaction partners. Together, our results demonstrate that obligate cross-feeding can significantly expand the ecological niche space of interacting bacterial genotypes, thus explaining the widespread occurrence of this type of ecological interaction in natural microbiomes.},

This partitioning of benefits, also called `leakiness', can produce negative frequency dependence of fitness in microbial communities, allowing coexistence between function-performing helpers and function-requiring beneficiaries. The ubiquity of leakiness favors a `race to the bottom'as members of a community lose the ability to perform functions whose products are available from the environment. Rather than being social altruists, helpers are merely those populations that lost this race and got stuck in their role as function performers. Here I discuss many such BQ functions and the microbial communities that evolve around them. I also compile evidence from laboratory evolution experiments as well as phylogenetic reconstructions that show that organisms gain greater fitness increases from gene/function loss events than is commonly expected. Finally, I consider possible consequences of long-term BQ-stabilized coexistence, including sympatric speciation and the evolution of true mutualisms.},

	Abstract = {Metabolic cross-feeding interactions are ubiquitous in natural microbial communities. However, it remains generally unclear whether the production and exchange of metabolites incurs fitness costs to the producing cells and if so, which ecological mechanisms can facilitate a cooperative exchange of metabolites among unrelated individuals. We hypothesized that positive assortment within structured environments can maintain mutualistic cross-feeding. To test this, we engineered Acinetobacter baylyi and Escherichia coli to reciprocally exchange essential amino acids. Interspecific coculture experiments confirmed that non-cooperating types were selectively favoured in spatially unstructured (liquid culture), yet disfavoured in spatially structured environments (agar plates). Both an individual-based model and experiments with engineered genotypes indicated that a segregation of cross-feeders and non-cooperating auxotrophs stabilized cooperative cross-feeding in spatially structured environments. Chemical imaging confirmed that auxotrophs were spatially excluded from cooperative benefits. Together, these results demonstrate that cooperative cross-feeding between different bacterial species is favoured in structured environments such as bacterial biofilms, suggesting this type of interactions might be common in natural bacterial communities.},

	Abstract = {As natural selection acts on individual organisms the evolution of costly cooperation between microorganisms is an intriguing phenomenon. Introduction of spatial structure to privatize exchanged molecules can explain the evolution of cooperation. However, in many natural systems cells can also grow to low cell concentrations in the absence of these exchanged molecules, thus showing ``cooperation-independent background growth''. We here serially propagated a synthetic cross-feeding consortium of lactococci in the droplets of a water-in-oil emulsion, essentially mimicking group selection with varying founder population sizes. The results show that when the growth of cheaters completely depends on cooperators, cooperators outcompete cheaters. However, cheaters outcompete cooperators when they can independently grow to only ten percent of the consortium carrying capacity. This result is the consequence of a probabilistic effect, as low founder population sizes in droplets decrease the frequency of cooperator co-localization. Cooperator-enrichment can be recovered by increasing the founder population size in droplets to intermediate values. Together with mathematical modelling our results suggest that co-localization probabilities in a spatially structured environment leave a small window of opportunity for the evolution of cooperation between organisms that do not benefit from their cooperative trait when in isolation or form multispecies aggregates.},

	N2 = {Evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs) involve the formation of Darwinian collectives from Darwinian particles. The transition from cells to multicellular life is a prime example. During anETI, collectives become units of selection in their own right. However, the underlying processes are poorly understood. One observation used to identify the completion of an ETI is an increase in collective-level performance accompanied by a decrease in particle-level performance, for example, measured by growth rate. This seemingly counterintuitive dynamic has been referred to as ``fitness decoupling''and has been used to interpret both models and experimental data. Using a mathematical approach we show this concept to be problematic in that the fitness of particles and collectives can never decouple: calculations of particle and collective fitness performed over appropriate and equivalent time intervals are necessarily the same. By way of solution, we draw attention to the value of mechanistic approaches that emphasise traits as opposed to fitness and tradeoffs among traits. This trait-based approach is sufficient to capture dynamics that underpin evolutionary transitions. In addition, drawing upon both experimental and theoretical studies, we show that while early stages of transitions might often involve tradeoffs among particle traits, later---and critical---stages are likely to involve rupture of such tradeoffs. Tradeoff-breaking thus stands as a useful marker for ETIs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

This maximization principle has been criticized on the (uncontested) grounds that other quantities, such as offspring number, predict gene frequency changes accurately in a wider range of mathematical models. Here, we adopt a resolution offered by Birch, who accepts the technical difficulties of establishing inclusive fitness maximization in a fully general model, while concluding that inclusive fitness is still useful as an organizing framework. We set out in more detail why inclusive fitness is such a practical and powerful framework, and provide verbal and conceptual arguments for why social biology would be more or less impossible without it. We aim to help mathematicians understand why social biologists are content to use inclusive fitness despite its theoretical weaknesses. Here, we also offer biologists practical advice for avoiding potential pitfalls.},

	N2 = {Inclusive fitness theory is the idea that the evolutionary success of a trait can be calculated as a sum of fitness effects multiplied by relatedness coefficients. Despite recent mathematical analyses demonstrating the limitations of this approach, its adherents claim that it is as general as the theory of natural selection itself. This claim is based on using linear regression to split an individual's fitness into components due to self and others. We show that this regression method is useless for the prediction or interpretation of evolutionary processes. In particular, it fails to distinguish between correlation and causation, leading to misinterpretations of simple scenarios. The weaknesses of the regression method underscore the limitations of inclusive fitness theory in general.Until recently, inclusive fitness has been widely accepted as a general method to explain the evolution of social behavior. Affirming and expanding earlier criticism, we demonstrate that inclusive fitness is instead a limited concept, which exists only for a small subset of evolutionary processes. Inclusive fitness assumes that personal fitness is the sum of additive components caused by individual actions. This assumption does not hold for the majority of evolutionary processes or scenarios. To sidestep this limitation, inclusive fitness theorists have proposed a method using linear regression. On the basis of this method, it is claimed that inclusive fitness theory (i) predicts the direction of allele frequency changes, (ii) reveals the reasons for these changes, (iii) is as general as natural selection, and (iv) provides a universal design principle for evolution. In this paper we evaluate these claims, and show that all of them are unfounded. If the objective is to analyze whether mutations that modify social behavior are favored or opposed by natural selection, then no aspect of inclusive fitness theory is needed.},

This means that some individuals sacrifice their own reproductive potential in order to raise the offspring of others, a fact that Darwin recognized as a challenge to evolutionary theory. The most widely accepted explanations for the phenomenon rely on kin selection theory based on inclusive fitness ---individual fitness derived by increasing the survival of a relatives' offspring. In an Analysis feature, Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita and Edward O. Wilson point out that this approach has its limitations. They demonstrate mathematically that inclusive fitness is a viable alternative to the direct fitness of standard natural selection only for a well-defined subset of situations ---it is not generally applicable. A simpler explanation is provided by standard natural selection theory in the context of precise models of population structure.},

	Abstract = {Biologists have taken the concept of organism largely for granted. However, advances in the study of chimerism, symbiosis, bacterial-eukaryote associations, and microbial behavior have prompted a redefinition of organisms as biological entities exhibiting low conflict and high cooperation among their parts. This expanded view identifies organisms in evolutionary time. However, the ecological processes, mechanisms, and traits that drive the formation of organisms remain poorly understood. Recognizing that organismality can be context dependent, we advocate elucidating the ecological contexts under which entities do or do not act as organisms. Here we develop a "contextual organismality" framework and provide examples of entities, such as honey bee colonies, tumors, and bacterial swarms, that can act as organisms under specific life history, resource, or other ecological circumstances. We suggest that context dependence may be a stepping stone to the development of increased organismal unification, as the most integrated biological entities generally show little context dependence. Recognizing that organismality is contextual can identify common patterns and testable hypotheses across different entities. The contextual organismality framework can illuminate timeless as well as pressing issues in biology, including topics as disparate as cancer emergence, genomic conflict, evolution of symbiosis, and the role of the microbiota in impacting host phenotype.},

	Abstract = {The major tenets of the recent hypothesis of punctuated equilibrium are explicit in Darwin's writing. His notes from 1837--1838 contain references to stasis and rapid change. In the first edition of the Origin (1859), Darwin described the importance of isolation of local varieties in the process of speciation. His views on the tempo of speciation were influenced by Hugh Falconer and also, perhaps, by Edward Suess (1831--1914). It is paradoxical that, although both topics were recorded in his unpublished notes of 1837--1838, the second was not explicitly and fully discussed until the fourth edition of the Origin (1866). While no wholly satisfactory explanation of this paradox suggests itself, it seems probable that Falconer's work on the persistence of fossil species of elephant helped Darwin to see the wider significance of the tempo of evolution for his general theory.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: This essay highlights critical aspects of the plausibility of pre-Darwinian evolution. It is based on a critical review of some better-known open, far-from-equilibrium system-based scenarios supposed to explain processes that took place before Darwinian evolution had emerged and that resulted in the origin of the first systems capable of Darwinian evolution. The researchers' responses to eight crucial questions are reviewed. The majority of the researchers claim that there would have been an evolutionary continuity between chemistry and "biology". A key question is how did this evolution begin before Darwinian evolution had begun? In other words the question is whether pre-Darwinian evolution is plausible. RESULTS: Strengths and weaknesses of the reviewed scenarios are presented. They are distinguished between metabolism-first, replicator-first and combined metabolism-replicator models. The metabolism-first scenarios show major issues, the worst concerns heredity and chirality. Although the replicator-first scenarios answer the heredity question they have their own problems, notably chirality. Among the reviewed combined metabolism-replicator models, one shows the fewest issues. In particular, it seems to answer the chiral question, and eventually implies Darwinian evolution from the very beginning. Its main hypothesis needs to be validated with experimental data. CONCLUSION: From this critical review it is that the concept of "pre-Darwinian evolution" appears questionable, in particular because it is unlikely if not impossible that any evolution in complexity over time may work without multiplication and heritability allowing the emergence of genetically and ecologically diverse lineages on which natural selection may operate. Only Darwinian evolution could have led to such an evolution. Thus, Pre-Darwinian evolution is not plausible according to the author. Surely, the answer to the question posed in the title is a prerequisite to the understanding of the origin of Darwinian evolution.

In contrast, when cells need to maximize the cell number at a limited nutrient supply, fast growth does not matter and an efficient use of nutrients (i.e. high biomass yield) is essential. This raises a basic question about metabolism: can cells achieve high growth rates and yields simultaneously, or is there a conflict between the two goals? Using a new modeling method called Enzymatic Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM), we predict cellular growth rates and find that growth rate/yield trade-offs and the ensuing preference for enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways are not universal, but depend on growth conditions such as external glucose and oxygen concentrations.},

	N2 = {Ernst Mayr played a central role in the establishment of the general concept of species as metapopulation lineages, and he is the author of one of the most popular of the numerous alternative definitions of the species category. Reconciliation of incompatible species definitions and the development of a unified species concept require rejecting the interpretation of various contingent properties of metapopulation lineages, including intrinsic reproductive isolation in Mayr's definition, as necessary properties of species. On the other hand, the general concept of species as metapopulation lineages advocated by Mayr forms the foundation of this reconciliation, which follows from a corollary of that concept also advocated by Mayr: the proposition that the species is a fundamental category of biological organization. Although the general metapopulation lineage species concept and Mayr's popular species definition are commonly confused under the name ``the biological species concept,''they are more or less clearly distinguished in Mayr's early writings on the subject. Virtually all modern concepts and definitions of the species category, not only those that require intrinsic reproductive isolation, are to be considered biological according to the criterion proposed by Mayr. Definitions of the species category that identify a particular contingent property of metapopulation lineages (including intrinsic reproductive isolation) as a necessary property of species reduce the number of metapopulation lineages that are to be recognized taxonomically as species, but they cause conflicts among alternative species definitions and compromise the status of the species as a basic category of biological organization.},

	Abstract = {The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract harbours a complex and dynamic population of microorganisms, the gut microbiota, which exert a marked influence on the host during homeostasis and disease. Multiple factors contribute to the establishment of the human gut microbiota during infancy. Diet is considered as one of the main drivers in shaping the gut microbiota across the life time. Intestinal bacteria play a crucial role in maintaining immune and metabolic homeostasis and protecting against pathogens. Altered gut bacterial composition (dysbiosis) has been associated with the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases and infections. The interpretation of these studies relies on a better understanding of inter-individual variations, heterogeneity of bacterial communities along and across the GI tract, functional redundancy and the need to distinguish cause from effect in states of dysbiosis. This review summarises our current understanding of the development and composition of the human GI microbiota, and its impact on gut integrity and host health, underlying the need for mechanistic studies focusing on host-microbe interactions.},

	Abstract = {Interest toward the human microbiome, particularly gut microbiome has flourished in recent decades owing to the rapidly advancing sequence-based screening and humanized gnotobiotic model in interrogating the dynamic operations of commensal microbiota. Although this field is still at a very preliminary stage, whereby the functional properties of the complex gut microbiome remain less understood, several promising findings have been documented and exhibit great potential toward revolutionizing disease etiology and medical treatments. In this review, the interactions between gut microbiota and the host have been focused on, to provide an overview of the role of gut microbiota and their unique metabolites in conferring host protection against invading pathogen, regulation of diverse host physiological functions including metabolism, development and homeostasis of immunity and the nervous system. We elaborate on how gut microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) may lead to dysfunction of host machineries, thereby contributing to pathogenesis and/or progression toward a broad spectrum of diseases. Some of the most notable diseases namely Clostridium difficile infection (infectious disease), inflammatory bowel disease (intestinal immune-mediated disease), celiac disease (multisystemic autoimmune disorder), obesity (metabolic disease), colorectal cancer, and autism spectrum disorder (neuropsychiatric disorder) have been discussed and delineated along with recent findings. Novel therapies derived from microbiome studies such as fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotic and prebiotics to target associated diseases have been reviewed to introduce the idea of how certain disease symptoms can be ameliorated through dysbiosis correction, thus revealing a new scientific approach toward disease treatment. Toward the end of this review, several research gaps and limitations have been described along with suggested future studies to overcome the current research lacunae. Despite the ongoing debate on whether gut microbiome plays a role in the above-mentioned diseases, we have in this review, gathered evidence showing a potentially far more complex link beyond the unidirectional cause-and-effect relationship between them.},

Unfortunately, obtaining an accurate number is constrained by the fact that most species remain to be described and because indirect attempts to answer this question have been highly controversial. Here, we document that the taxonomic classification of species into higher taxonomic groups (from genera to phyla) follows a consistent pattern from which the total number of species in any taxonomic group can be predicted. Assessment of this pattern for all kingdoms of life on Earth predicts ∼8.7 million ($\pm$1.3 million SE) species globally, of which ∼2.2 million ($\pm$0.18 million SE) are marine. Our results suggest that some 86{\%} of the species on Earth, and 91{\%} in the ocean, still await description. Closing this knowledge gap will require a renewed interest in exploration and taxonomy, and a continuing effort to catalogue existing biodiversity data in publicly available databases.},

We then show a unified scaling law that predicts the abundance of dominant species across 30 orders of magnitude to the scale of all microorganisms on Earth. Using this scaling law combined with the lognormal model of biodiversity, we predict that Earth is home to as many as 1 trillion (1012) microbial species.Scaling laws underpin unifying theories of biodiversity and are among the most predictively powerful relationships in biology. However, scaling laws developed for plants and animals often go untested or fail to hold for microorganisms. As a result, it is unclear whether scaling laws of biodiversity will span evolutionarily distant domains of life that encompass all modes of metabolism and scales of abundance. Using a global-scale compilation of ∼35,000 sites and ∼5.6⋅106 species, including the largest ever inventory of high-throughput molecular data and one of the largest compilations of plant and animal community data, we show similar rates of scaling in commonness and rarity across microorganisms and macroscopic plants and animals. We document a universal dominance scaling law that holds across 30 orders of magnitude, an unprecedented expanse that predicts the abundance of dominant ocean bacteria. In combining this scaling law with the lognormal model of biodiversity, we predict that Earth is home to upward of 1 trillion (1012) microbial species.

	Abstract = {The Palaeoarchean supracrustal belts in Greenland contain Earth's oldest rocks and are a prime target in the search for the earliest evidence of life on Earth. However, metamorphism has largely obliterated original rock textures and compositions, posing a challenge to the preservation of biological signatures. A recent study of 3,700-million-year-old rocks of the Isua supracrustal belt in Greenland described a rare zone in which low deformation and a closed metamorphic system allowed preservation of primary sedimentary features, including putative conical and domical stromatolites1 (laminated accretionary structures formed by microbially mediated sedimentation). The morphology, layering, mineralogy, chemistry and geological context of the structures were attributed to the formation of microbial mats in a shallow marine environment by 3,700 million years ago, at the start of Earth's rock record. Here we report new research that shows a non-biological, post-depositional origin for the structures. Three-dimensional analysis of the morphology and orientation of the structures within the context of host rock fabrics, combined with texture-specific analyses of major and trace element chemistry, show that the `stromatolites'are more plausibly interpreted as part of an assemblage of deformation structures formed in carbonate-altered metasediments long after burial. The investigation of the structures of the Isua supracrustal belt serves as a cautionary tale in the search for signs of past life on Mars, highlighting the importance of three-dimensional, integrated analysis of morphology, rock fabrics and geochemistry at appropriate scales.},

	Abstract = {Positive species interactions underlie the functioning of ecosystems. Given their importance, it is crucial to understand the stability of positive interactions over evolutionary timescales, in both constant and fluctuating environments; e.g., environments interrupted with periods of competition. We addressed this question using a two-species microbial system in which we modulated interactions according to the nutrient provided. We evolved in parallel four experimental replicates of species growing in isolation or together in consortia for 200 generations in both a constant and fluctuating environment with daily changes between commensalism and competition. We sequenced full genomes of single clones isolated at different time points during the experiment. We found that the two species coexisted over 200 generations in the constant commensal environment. In contrast, in the fluctuating environment, coexistence broke down when one of the species went extinct in two out of four cases. We showed that extinction was highly deterministic: when we replayed the evolution experiment from an intermediate time point we repeatably reproduced species extinction. We further show that these dynamics were driven by adaptive mutations in a small set of genes. In conclusion, in a fluctuating environment, rapid evolution destabilizes the long-term stability of positive pairwise interactions.},

	Abstract = {Biofilms are specialized environments where communities of microorganisms are insulated from the outside world by an extracellular polymer matrix that they themselves secrete. The resulting microbial mats have been compared to tropical rainforests in terms of complexity and biodiversity. Selective pressures on such biofilms are likely to demand intense interactions between the individual bacteria, and an experiment with a simple community of two species (soil dwellers Pseudomonas putida and Acinetobacter sp.) shows just how close that relationship is. The physical structure of the community altered, to the mutual benefit of both species, as a result of a simple mutation in the genome of one of the species. In the absence of a partner the mutation (in P. putida) would have been deleterious. This system demonstrates the importance of interspecies interactions, and may be useful in work on the evolution of these interactions.},

During this transition the unit of selection shifts from individual cells to groups of cooperating cells1,3,4. Although there is much theory5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15, there are few empirical studies16. Here we describe an evolutionary transition that occurs in experimental populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens propagated in a spatially heterogeneous environment17. Cooperating groups are formed by over-production of an adhesive polymer18, which causes the interests of individuals to align with those of the group. The costs and benefits of cooperation, plus evolutionary susceptibility to defecting genotypes, were analysed to determine conformation to theory1,3,12. Cooperation was costly to individuals, but beneficial to the group. Defecting genotypes evolved in populations founded by the cooperating type and were fitter in the presence of this type than in its absence. In the short term, defectors sabotaged the viability of the group; but these findings nevertheless show that transitions to higher orders of complexity are readily achievable, provide insights into the selective conditions, and facilitate experimental analysis of the evolution of individuality.},

The effects of adaptive radiation are often seen4,5,6, but the underlying causes are difficult to disentangle and remain unclear7,8,9. Here we examine directly therole of ecological opportunity and competition in driving genetic diversification. We use the common aerobic bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens10, which evolves rapidly under novel environmental conditions to generate a large repertoire of mutants11,12,13. When provided with ecological opportunity (afforded by spatial structure), identical populations diversify morphologically, but when ecological opportunity is restricted there is no such divergence. In spatially structured environments, the evolution of variant morphs follows a predictable sequence and we show that competition among the newly evolved niche-specialists maintains this variation. These results demonstrate that the elementary processes of mutation and selection alone are suifficient to promote rapid proliferation of new designs and support the theory that trade-offs in competitive ability drive adaptive radiation14,15.},

	Abstract = {Cellular populations in both nature and the laboratory are composed of phenotypically heterogeneous individuals that compete with each other resulting in complex population dynamics. Predicting population growth characteristics based on knowledge of heterogeneous single-cell dynamics remains challenging. By observing groups of cells for hundreds of generations at single-cell resolution, we reveal that growth noise causes clonal populations of Escherichia coli to double faster than the mean doubling time of their constituent single cells across a broad set of balanced-growth conditions. We show that the population-level growth rate gain as well as age structures of populations and of cell lineages in competition are predictable. Furthermore, we theoretically reveal that the growth rate gain can be linked with the relative entropy of lineage generation time distributions. Unexpectedly, we find an empirical linear relation between the means and the variances of generation times across conditions, which provides a general constraint on maximal growth rates. Together, these results demonstrate a fundamental benefit of noise for population growth, and identify a growth law that sets a "speed limit" for proliferation.},

However, the degree to which a genome is robust, that is, able to withstand changes and how robustness affects evolution is unclear. Payne and Wagner (p. 875) investigated the empirical support for mutational robustness by examining transcription factor (TF) binding in the mouse and yeast genomes. A network analysis of the degree of variation revealed that the sites with the highest affinity for TF binding exhibit the greatest tolerance for nucleotide substitutions, whereas low-affinity sites exhibit greater sensitivity to mutation. Thus, while mutational robustness and evolvability are antagonistic at the genotypic level, they are synergistic at the phenotypic level. Robustness, the maintenance of a character in the presence of genetic change, can help preserve adaptive traits but also may hinder evolvability, the ability to bring forth novel adaptations. We used genotype networks to analyze the binding site repertoires of 193 transcription factors from mice and yeast, providing empirical evidence that robustness and evolvability need not be conflicting properties. Network vertices represent binding sites where two sites are connected if they differ in a single nucleotide. We show that the binding sites of larger genotype networks are not only more robust, but the sequences adjacent to such networks can also bind more transcription factors, thus demonstrating that robustness can facilitate evolvability.},

Gene regulatory circuits often have multiple functions. This means that they can form different gene expression patterns at different times or in different tissues. We know little about multifunctional gene regulatory circuits. For example, we do not know how multifunctionality constrains the evolution of such circuits, how many circuits exist that have a given number of functions, and whether tradeoffs exist between multifunctionality and the robustness of a circuit to mutation. Because it is not currently possible to answer these questions experimentally, we use a computational model to exhaustively enumerate millions of regulatory circuits and all their possible functions, thereby providing the first comprehensive study of multifunctionality in model regulatory circuits. Our results highlight limits of circuit designability that are relevant to both systems biologists and synthetic biologists.},

The phenotypes produced by transcriptional regulatory circuits are gene expression patterns that are to some extent robust to mutations. Here we review several causes of this robustness. They include robustness of individual transcription factor binding sites, homotypic clusters of such sites, redundant enhancers, transcription factors, redundant transcription factors, and the wiring of transcriptional regulatory circuits. Such robustness can either be an adaptation by itself, a byproduct of other adaptations, or the result of biophysical principles and non-adaptive forces of genome evolution. The potential consequences of such robustness include complex regulatory network topologies that arise through neutral evolution, as well as cryptic variation, i.e., genotypic divergence without phenotypic divergence. On the longest evolutionary timescales, the robustness of transcriptional regulation has helped shape life as we know it, by facilitating evolutionary innovations that helped organisms such as flowering plants and vertebrates diversify.},

	N2 = {Abstract There is tantalizing evidence that phenotypic plasticity can buffer novel, adaptive genetic variants long enough to permit their evolutionary spread, and this process is often invoked in explanations for rapid adaptive evolution. However, the strength and generality of evidence for it is controversial. We identify a conceptual problem affecting this debate: recombination, segregation, and independent assortment are expected to quickly sever associations between genes controlling novel adaptations and genes contributing to trait plasticity that facilitates the novel adaptations by reducing their indirect fitness costs. To make clearer predictions about this role of plasticity in facilitating genetic adaptation, we describe a testable genetic mechanism that resolves the problem: genetic covariance between new adaptive variants and trait plasticity that facilitates their persistence within populations. We identify genetic architectures that might lead to such a covariance, including genetic coupling via physical linkage and pleiotropy, and illustrate the consequences for adaptation rates using numerical simulations. Such genetic covariances may also arise from the social environment, and we suggest the indirect genetic effects that result could further accentuate the process of adaptation. We call the latter mechanism of adaptation social drive, and identify methods to test it. We suggest that genetic coupling of plasticity and adaptations could promote unusually rapid ?runaway? evolution of novel adaptations. The resultant dynamics could facilitate evolutionary rescue, adaptive radiations, the origin of novelties, and other commonly studied processes.},

@article{Meyer07,
	Abstract = {The diversity of life is thought to have arisen through a series of 'bursts' of evolution, or 'adaptive radiations'. What conditions cause these bursts, and why do they occur after mass extinctions, on islands, and sporadically through time? Justin Meyer and Rees Kassen provide experimental evidence, in a community containing the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila and its bacterial prey, that the evolutionary processes causing the bursts are influenced by predators. For reducing prey populations, predators slow the rate at which prey species diverge into new forms. Predators are rare on deserted islands, and at times of mass extinctions, suggesting that their absence is a catalyst to the bursts of evolution that occur then. In a separate paper Fukami et al. use model bacterial populations to show that biodiversity is a product of both the ecological process of immigration into communities, and the evolutionary process of diversification within communities.},

	Abstract = {As has been studied extensively for macroorganisms, competition between and within microbial species constitutes a crucial facet of microbial life in the environment.Individuals in a population of a single bacterial species will be in competition with each other when nutrients are limiting. If the ecological opportunity arises (such as when populations are grown in a spatially structured environment, providing multiple niches), intraspecies competition can lead to selection for the diversification of a bacterial population.Under some conditions, cooperation among individuals in a bacterial population can facilitate competition between groups. However, cooperation can be vulnerable to cheating.Bacteria engage in diverse active competitive strategies. These include: accumulating and storing specific nutrients, thereby depriving potential competitors; blocking access to favourable habitats (such as binding sites on a surface) or forcing the dispersal of competitors; motility, especially when directed (chemotaxis); producing antimicrobial toxins; and interfering with competitors' signalling.Microbial systems should be exploited further for testing ecological theories of competition. Additionally, new technologies should aid in moving the study of bacterial competition from the test tube to the natural habitats of microorganisms.},

@article{Barraclough12,
	Abstract = {The same evolutionary forces that cause diversification in sexual eukaryotes are expected to cause diversification in bacteria. However, in bacteria, the wider variety of mechanisms for gene exchange (or lack thereof) increases the range of expected diversity patterns compared to those of sexual organisms. Two parallel concepts for bacterial speciation have developed, based on ecological divergence or barriers to recombination in turn. Recent evidence from DNA sequence data shows that both processes can generate independently evolving groups that are equivalent to sexual species and that represent separate arenas within which recombination (when it occurs), selection and drift occur. It remains unclear, however, how often different processes act in concert to generate simple units of diversity, or whether a more complex model of diversity is required, specifying hierarchical levels at which different cohesive processes operate. We advocate an integrative approach that evaluates the effects of multiple evolutionary forces on diversity patterns. There is also great potential for laboratory studies of bacterial evolution that test evolutionary mechanisms inferred from population genetic analyses of multi-locus and genome sequence data.},

@article{Kassen04,
	Abstract = {Taxonomic diversification commonly occurs through adaptive radiation, the rapid evolution of a single lineage into a range of genotypes or species each adapted to a different ecological niche1,2. Radiation size (measured as the number of new types) varies widely between phylogenetically distinct taxa2,3,4 and between replicate radiations within a single taxon where the ecological opportunities available seem to be identical5,6. Here we show how variation in energy input (productivity) and environmental disturbance combine to determine the extent of diversification in a single radiating lineage of Pseudomonas fluorescens adapting to laboratory conditions. Diversity peaked at intermediate rates of both productivity and disturbance and declined towards the extremes in a manner reminiscent of well-known ecological patterns7,8,9. The mechanism responsible for the decrease in diversity arises from pleiotropic fitness costs associated with niche specialization10,11, the effects of which are modulated by gradients of productivity and disturbance. Our results indicate that ecological gradients may constrain the size of adaptive radiations, even in the presence of the strong diversifying selection associated with ecological opportunity, by decoupling evolutionary diversification from ecological coexistence.},

Here we take advantage of the model bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens in which the genotype-to-phenotype map determining evolution of the adaptive `wrinkly spreader'(WS) type is known. We present mathematical descriptions of three necessary regulatory pathways and use these to predict both the rate at which each mutational route is used and the expected mutational targets. To test predictions, mutation rates and targets were determined for each pathway. Unanticipated mutational hotspots caused experimental observations to depart from predictions but additional data led to refined models. A mismatch was observed between the spectra of WS-causing mutations obtained with and without selection due to low fitness of previously undetected WS-causing mutations. Our findings contribute toward the development of mechanistic models for forecasting evolution, highlight current limitations, and draw attention to challenges in predicting locus-specific mutational biases and fitness effects.},

	Abstract = {Global gene expression measurements are increasingly obtained as a function of cell type, spatial position within a tissue and other biologically meaningful coordinates. Such data should enable quantitative analysis of the cell-type specificity of gene expression, but such analyses can often be confounded by the presence of noise. We introduce a specificity measure Spec that quantifies the information in a gene's complete expression profile regarding any given cell type, and an uncertainty measure dSpec, which measures the effect of noise on specificity. Using global gene expression data from the mouse brain, plant root and human white blood cells, we show that Spec identifies genes with variable expression levels that are nonetheless highly specific of particular cell types. When samples from different individuals are used, dSpec measures genes' transcriptional plasticity in each cell type. Our approach is broadly applicable to mapped gene expression measurements in stem cell biology, developmental biology, cancer biology and biomarker identification. As an example of such applications, we show that Spec identifies a new class of biomarkers, which exhibit variable expression without compromising specificity. The approach provides a unifying theoretical framework for quantifying specificity in the presence of noise, which is widely applicable across diverse biological systems.},

Prolonged selection in spatially structured microcosms caused the cost of specialization to decline without loss of the benefits associated with specialization. The decline in the cost of specialization can be explained by either compensatory adaptation within specialist lineages or clonal competition among specialist lineages.

Such variation may impact the evolvability of proteins, but the underlying molecular basis remains unclear. Here, we performed comparative directed evolution of four orthologous metallo-β-lactamases toward a new function and found that different starting genotypes evolved to distinct evolutionary outcomes. Despite a low initial fitness, one ortholog reached a significantly higher fitness plateau than its counterparts, via increasing catalytic activity. By contrast, the ortholog with the highest initial activity evolved to a less-optimal and phenotypically distinct outcome through changes in expression, oligomerization and activity. We show how cryptic molecular properties and conformational variation of active site residues in the initial genotypes cause epistasis, that could lead to distinct evolutionary outcomes. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the molecular details that connect genetic variation to protein function to improve the prediction of protein evolution.},

How do mutations alter the molecular architecture of enzymes to enhance their activities? Can we infer general mechanisms that are common to most enzymes, or does each enzyme require a unique optimization process? The ability to predict the location and type of mutations necessary to enhance an enzyme's activity is critical to protein engineering and rational design. In this review, via the detailed examination of recent studies that have shed new light on the molecular changes underlying the optimization of enzyme function, we provide a mechanistic perspective of enzyme evolution. We first present a global survey of the prevalence of activity-enhancing mutations and their distribution within protein structures. We then delve into the molecular solutions that mediate functional optimization, specifically highlighting several common mechanisms that have been observed across multiple examples. As distinct protein sequences encounter different evolutionary bottlenecks, different mechanisms are likely to emerge along evolutionary trajectories toward improved function. Identifying the specific mechanism(s) that need to be improved upon, and tailoring our engineering efforts to each sequence, may considerably improve our chances to succeed in generating highly efficient catalysts in the future.},

	Abstract = {Proteins are molecular machines composed of complex, highly connected amino acid networks. Their functional optimization requires the reorganization of these intramolecular networks by evolution. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which epistasis, that is, the dependence of the effect of a mutation on the genetic background, rewires intramolecular interactions to alter protein function. Deciphering the biophysical basis of epistasis is crucial to our understanding of evolutionary dynamics and the elucidation of sequence-structure-function relationships. We featured recent studies that provide insights into the molecular mechanisms giving rise to epistasis, particularly at the structural level. These studies illustrate the convoluted and fascinating nature of the intramolecular networks co-opted by epistasis during the evolution of protein function.},

	Abstract = {Explaining altruistic cooperation is one of the greatest challenges for evolutionary biology1,2,3. One solution to this problem is if costly cooperative behaviours are directed towards relatives4,5. This idea of kin selection has been hugely influential and applied widely from microorganisms to vertebrates2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. However, a problem arises if there is local competition for resources, because this leads to competition between relatives, reducing selection for cooperation3,11,12,13,14. Here we use an experimental evolution approach to test the effect of the scale of competition, and how it interacts with relatedness. The cooperative trait that we examine is the production of siderophores, iron-scavenging agents, in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa15,16,17. As expected, our results show that higher levels of cooperative siderophore production evolve in the higher relatedness treatments. However, our results also show that more local competition selects for lower levels of siderophore production and that there is a significant interaction between relatedness and the scale of competition, with relatedness having less effect when the scale of competition is more local. More generally, the scale of competition is likely to be of particular importance for the evolution of cooperation in microorganisms, and also the virulence of pathogenic microorganisms, because cooperative traits such as siderophore production have an important role in determining virulence6,9,17,18,19.},

	Abstract = {Increases in biological complexity and the origins of life's hierarchical organization are described by the ``major transitions''framework. A crucial component of this paradigm is that after the transition in complexity or organization, adaptation occurs primarily at the level of the new, higher-level unit. For collective-level adaptations to occur, though, collective-level traits---properties of the group, such as collective size---must be heritable. Since collective-level trait values are functions of lower-level trait values, collective-level heritability is related to particle-level heritability. However, the nature of this relationship has rarely been explored in the context of major transitions.},

For collectives to undergo Darwinian evolution, their traits must be heritable, but the emergence of higher-level heritability is poorly understood and has long been considered a stumbling block for nascent evolutionary transitions. A change in the means by which genetic information is utilized and transmitted has been presumed necessary. Using analytical models, synthetic biology, and biologicallyinformed simulations, we explored the emergence of trait heritability during the evolution of multicellularity. Contrary to existing theory, we show that no additional layer of genetic regulation is necessary for traits of nascent multicellular organisms to become heritable; rather, heritability and the capacity to respond to natural selection on multicellular-level traits can arise ``for free.''In fact, we find that a key emergent multicellular trait, organism size at reproduction, is usually more heritable than the underlying cell-level trait upon which it is based, given reasonable assumptions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{Skejo21,
	Abstract = {Modern accounts of eukaryogenesis entail an endosymbiotic encounter between an archaeal host and a proteobacterial endosymbiont, with subsequent evolution giving rise to a unicell possessing a single nucleus and mitochondria. The mononucleate state of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) is seldom, if ever, questioned, even though cells harboring multiple (syncytia, coenocytes, and polykaryons) are surprisingly common across eukaryotic supergroups. Here, we present a survey of multinucleated forms. Ancestral character state reconstruction for representatives of 106 eukaryotic taxa using 16 different possible roots and supergroup sister relationships, indicate that LECA, in addition to being mitochondriate, sexual, and meiotic, was multinucleate. LECA exhibited closed mitosis, which is the rule for modern syncytial forms, shedding light on the mechanics of its chromosome segregation. A simple mathematical model shows that within LECA's multinucleate cytosol, relationships among mitochondria and nuclei were neither one-to-one, nor one-to-many, but many-to-many, placing mitonuclear interactions and cytonuclear compatibility at the evolutionary base of eukaryotic cell origin. Within a syncytium, individual nuclei and individual mitochondria function as the initial lower-level evolutionary units of selection, as opposed to individual cells, during eukaryogenesis. Nuclei within a syncytium rescue each other's lethal mutations, thereby postponing selection for viable nuclei and cytonuclear compatibility to the generation of spores, buffering transitional bottlenecks at eukaryogenesis. The prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition is traditionally thought to have left no intermediates, yet if eukaryogenesis proceeded via a syncytial common ancestor, intermediate forms have persisted to the present throughout the eukaryotic tree as syncytia but have so far gone unrecognized.},

@article{Ku15,
	Abstract = {Endosymbiotic theory in eukaryotic-cell evolution rests upon a foundation of three cornerstone partners--the plastid (a cyanobacterium), the mitochondrion (a proteobacterium), and its host (an archaeon)--and carries a corollary that, over time, the majority of genes once present in the organelle genomes were relinquished to the chromosomes of the host (endosymbiotic gene transfer). However, notwithstanding eukaryote-specific gene inventions, single-gene phylogenies have never traced eukaryotic genes to three single prokaryotic sources, an issue that hinges crucially upon factors influencing phylogenetic inference. In the age of genomes, single-gene trees, once used to test the predictions of endosymbiotic theory, now spawn new theories that stand to eventually replace endosymbiotic theory with descriptive, gene tree-based variants featuring supernumerary symbionts: prokaryotic partners distinct from the cornerstone trio and whose existence is inferred solely from single-gene trees. We reason that the endosymbiotic ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts brought into the eukaryotic--and plant and algal--lineage a genome-sized sample of genes from the proteobacterial and cyanobacterial pangenomes of their respective day and that, even if molecular phylogeny were artifact-free, sampling prokaryotic pangenomes through endosymbiotic gene transfer would lead to inherited chimerism. Recombination in prokaryotes (transduction, conjugation, transformation) differs from recombination in eukaryotes (sex). Prokaryotic recombination leads to pangenomes, and eukaryotic recombination leads to vertical inheritance. Viewed from the perspective of endosymbiotic theory, the critical transition at the eukaryote origin that allowed escape from Muller's ratchet--the origin of eukaryotic recombination, or sex--might have required surprisingly little evolutionary innovation.},

@article{Glansdorff08,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the reclassification of all life forms in three Domains (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya), the identity of their alleged forerunner (Last Universal Common Ancestor or LUCA) has been the subject of extensive controversies: progenote or already complex organism, prokaryote or protoeukaryote, thermophile or mesophile, product of a protracted progression from simple replicators to complex cells or born in the cradle of "catalytically closed" entities? We present a critical survey of the topic and suggest a scenario. RESULTS: LUCA does not appear to have been a simple, primitive, hyperthermophilic prokaryote but rather a complex community of protoeukaryotes with a RNA genome, adapted to a broad range of moderate temperatures, genetically redundant, morphologically and metabolically diverse. LUCA's genetic redundancy predicts loss of paralogous gene copies in divergent lineages to be a significant source of phylogenetic anomalies, i.e. instances where a protein tree departs from the SSU-rRNA genealogy; consequently, horizontal gene transfer may not have the rampant character assumed by many. Examining membrane lipids suggest LUCA had sn1,2 ester fatty acid lipids from which Archaea emerged from the outset as thermophilic by "thermoreduction," with a new type of membrane, composed of sn2,3 ether isoprenoid lipids; this occurred without major enzymatic reconversion. Bacteria emerged by reductive evolution from LUCA and some lineages further acquired extreme thermophily by convergent evolution. This scenario is compatible with the hypothesis that the RNA to DNA transition resulted from different viral invasions as proposed by Forterre. Beyond the controversy opposing "replication first" to metabolism first", the predictive arguments of theories on "catalytic closure" or "compositional heredity" heavily weigh in favour of LUCA's ancestors having emerged as complex, self-replicating entities from which a genetic code arose under natural selection. CONCLUSION: Life was born complex and the LUCA displayed that heritage. It had the "body "of a mesophilic eukaryote well before maturing by endosymbiosis into an organism adapted to an atmosphere rich in oxygen. Abundant indications suggest reductive evolution of this complex and heterogeneous entity towards the "prokaryotic" Domains Archaea and Bacteria. The word "prokaryote" should be abandoned because epistemologically unsound. REVIEWERS: This article was reviewed by Anthony Poole, Patrick Forterre, and Nicolas Galtier.},

	Abstract = {The colonization of emergent continental landmass by microbial life was an evolutionary step of paramount importance in Earth history. Here we report direct fossil evidence for life on land 3,220 million years ago (Ma) in the form of terrestrial microbial mats draping fluvial conglomerates and gravelly sandstones of the Moodies Group, South Africa. Combined field, petrographic, carbon isotope and Raman spectroscopic analyses confirm the synsedimentary origin and biogenicity of these unique fossil mats as well as their fluvial habitat. The carbon isotope compositions of organic matter (δ13Corg) from these mats define a narrow range centred on −21‰, in contrast to fossil mats of marine origin from nearby tidal deposits that show δ13Corg values as low as −34‰. Bulk nitrogen isotope compositions (2 < δ15N < 5‰) are also significantly different from their marine counterparts (0 < δ15N < 3‰), which we interpret as reflecting denitrification in the terrestrial habitat, possibly of an atmospheric source of nitrate. Our results support the antiquity of a thriving terrestrial biosphere during the Palaeoarchaean and suggest that a complex and microbially driven redox landscape existed during the deposition of the Moodies Group, with distinct biogeochemical cycling occurring on land by 3,220 Ma.},

One of them is stochastic phenotypic switching, by which some individuals in the community are enabled to tackle adverse conditions, even at the price of reducing overall growth in the short term. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of these ``bet-hedging''strategies for a population in the process of colonizing new territory. We show that bet-hedging is more advantageous when the environment varies spatially rather than temporally, and infrequently rather than frequently.},

	Abstract = {Diversified bet-hedging for life cycle duration is defined as within-generation variability in cycle length expressed by a single genotype maximising mean geometric fitness. Such plasticity is not predictive, i.e. it is not a response to cues from the environment that has a predictive value for the decision at hand. In evolutionary terms, diversified bet-hedging is perceived as an adaptation to environmental stochasticity. However, clear evidence of bet-hedging is scarce and exists only for a few desert plant species and one desert bee. In temperate insects, diversified bet-hedging for life cycle duration has been suspected in the chestnut weevil, but proximate factors responsible for individual variation are still unknown. From field experiments, we show that the frequency of the long cycle depends on larval weight and on the date when a larva abandons the fruit, but not on larval burying depth in the soil. Since the two first factors are known to depend on food and temperature and cannot lead to predictive plasticity, we give evidence of bet hedging in this temperate species. Indeed, despite a cost associated with prolonged diapause (extra mortality and loss of reproductive opportunity), a previous study showed that plasticity for life cycle duration, such as discussed in this paper, maximises mean geometric fitness and persistence probability in the chestnut weevil. We propose the hypothesis that the variation in life cycle duration depends on individual variability of metabolic resources such as lipids.},

But observing adaptive plasticity does not prove that the response evolved because it improved survival. Being plastic is only selected for if individuals experience environmental variation, so that in slow changing environments plasticity may be selected against even if it is adaptive in the long term. Can adaptive plastic responses still evolve under these conditions? Yes. We use learning theory to describe how genetic changes accumulate when individual lifespan is shorter than the time between environmental changes, and show that adaptively plastic responses can evolve even when they are selected against. This is because adaptive plastic responses can evolve as the by-product of selection for different functions in different environments, as long as organisms retain some plasticity until the next environmental change. Our work demonstrates that evolution can reach general solutions even when each individual is only presented with a simple fraction of a more complex problem. This intuition could explain why plastic responses to past environments can be adaptive even to environments the entire lineage has never seen before.},

@article{Bateson14,
	Abstract = {Many forms of developmental plasticity have been observed and these are usually beneficial to the organism. The Predictive Adaptive Response (PAR) hypothesis refers to a form of developmental plasticity in which cues received in early life influence the development of a phenotype that is normally adapted to the environmental conditions of later life. When the predicted and actual environments differ, the mismatch between the individual's phenotype and the conditions in which it finds itself can have adverse consequences for Darwinian fitness and, later, for health. Numerous examples exist of the long-term effects of cues indicating a threatening environment affecting the subsequent phenotype of the individual organism. Other examples consist of the long-term effects of variations in environment within a normal range, particularly in the individual's nutritional environment. In mammals the cues to developing offspring are often provided by the mother's plane of nutrition, her body composition or stress levels. This hypothetical effect in humans is thought to be important by some scientists and controversial by others. In resolving the conflict, distinctions should be drawn between PARs induced by normative variations in the developmental environment and the ill effects on development of extremes in environment such as a very poor or very rich nutritional environment. Tests to distinguish between different developmental processes impacting on adult characteristics are proposed. Many of the mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity involve molecular epigenetic processes, and their elucidation in the context of PARs and more widely has implications for the revision of classical evolutionary theory.},

The evolution of switches between alternative phenotypes as a response to different environmental cues and the evolution of the control of the temporal expression of alternative phenotypes within an organism's life cycle are here treated together as different dimensions of the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype, fostering the emergence of a more general and comprehensive picture of phenotypic evolution through a quite diverse sample of case studies. This introductory article reviews fundamental facts and concepts about phenotypic plasticity, adopting the most authoritative terminology in use in the current literature. The main topics are types and components of phenotypic variation, the evolution of organismal traits through plasticity, the origin and evolution of phenotypic plasticity and its adaptive value.},

	N2 = {Abstract Adaptive phenotypic plasticity is an important source of intraspecific variation, and for many plastic traits, the costs or factors limiting plasticity seem cryptic. However, there are several different factors that may constrain the evolution of plasticity, but few models have considered costs and limiting factors simultaneously. Here we use a simulation model to investigate how the optimal level of plasticity in a population depends on a fixed maintenance fitness cost for plasticity or an incremental fitness cost for producing a plastic response in combination with environmental unpredictability (environmental fluctuation speed) limiting plasticity. Our model identifies two mechanisms that act, almost separately, to constrain the evolution of plasticity: (i) the fitness cost of plasticity scaled by the nonplastic environmental tolerance, and (ii) the environmental fluctuation speed scaled by the rate of phenotypic change. That is, the evolution of plasticity is constrained by the high cost of plasticity in combination with high tolerance for environmental variation, or fast environmental changes in combination with slow plastic response. Qualitatively similar results are found when maintenance and incremental fitness costs of plasticity are incorporated, although a larger degree of plasticity is selected for with an incremental cost. Our model highlights that it is important to consider direct fitness costs and phenotypic limitations in relation to nonplastic environmental tolerance and environmental fluctuations, respectively, to understand what constrains the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.},

@article{Campbell13,
	Abstract = {In human health and disease the choreographed actions of a wide armory of transcription factors govern the regulated expression of coding and nonprotein coding genes. These actions are central to human health and are evidently aberrant in cancer. Central components of regulated gene expression are a variety of epigenetic mechanisms that include histone modifications. The post-translational modifications of histones are widespread and diverse, and appear to be spatial--temporally regulated in a highly intricate manner. The true functional consequences of these patterns of regulation are still emerging. Correlative evidence supports the idea that these patterns are distorted in malignancy on both a genome-wide and a discrete gene loci level. These patterns of distortion also often reflect the altered expression of the enzymes that control these histone states. Similarly gene expression patterns also appear to reflect a correlation with altered histone modifications at both the candidate loci and genome-wide level. Clarity is emerging in resolving these relationships between histone modification status and gene expression -patterns. For example, altered transcription factor interactions with the key co-activator and co-repressors, which in turn marshal many of the histone-modifying enzymes, may distort regulation of histone modifications at specific gene loci. In turn these aberrant transcriptional processes can trigger other altered epigenetic events such as DNA methylation and underline the aberrant and specific gene expression patterns in cancer. Considered in this manner, altered expression and recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes may underline the distortion to transcriptional responsiveness observed in malignancy. Insight from understanding these processes addresses the challenge of targeted epigenetic therapies in cancer.},

Here, we consider the importance of both genetic and non-genetic ITH and their role in tumour evolution, and present the rationale for a broad research focus beyond the cancer genome.

@article{Mroz17,
	Abstract = {The authors review and discuss the implications of genomic analyses documenting the diversity of tumors, both among patients and within individual tumors. Genetic diversity among solid tumors limits targeted therapies, because few mutations that drive tumors are both targetable and at high prevalence. Many more driver mutations and how they affect cellular signaling pathways must be identified if targeted therapy is to become widely useful. Genetic diversity within a tumor-intratumor genetic heterogeneity-makes the tumor a collection of subclones: related yet distinct cancers. Selection for pre-existing, resistant subclones by conventional or targeted therapies may explain many treatment failures. Immune therapy faces the same fundamental challenges. Nevertheless, the processes that generate and maintain heterogeneity might provide novel therapeutic targets. Addressing both types of diversity requires genomic tumor analyses linked to detailed clinical data. The trend toward sequencing restricted cancer gene panels, however, limits the ability to discover new driver mutations and assess intratumor heterogeneity. Clinical data currently collected with genomic analyses often lack critical information, substantially limiting their use in understanding tumor diversity. Now that diversity among and within tumors can no longer be ignored, research and clinical practice must adapt to take diversity into account.

	N2 = {A tumor comprising many cells can be compared to a natural population with many individuals. The amount of genetic diversity reflects how it has evolved and can influence its future evolution. We evaluated a single tumor by sequencing or genotyping nearly 300 regions from the tumor. When the data were analyzed by modern population genetic theory, we estimated more than 100 million coding region mutations in this unexceptional tumor. The extreme genetic diversity implies evolution under the non-Darwinian mode. In contrast, under the prevailing view of Darwinian selection, the genetic diversity would be orders of magnitude lower. Because genetic diversity accrues rapidly, a high probability of drug resistance should be heeded, even in the treatment of microscopic tumors.The prevailing view that the evolution of cells in a tumor is driven by Darwinian selection has never been rigorously tested. Because selection greatly affects the level of intratumor genetic diversity, it is important to assess whether intratumor evolution follows the Darwinian or the non-Darwinian mode of evolution. To provide the statistical power, many regions in a single tumor need to be sampled and analyzed much more extensively than has been attempted in previous intratumor studies. Here, from a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor, we evaluated multiregional samples from the tumor, using either whole-exome sequencing (WES) (n = 23 samples) or genotyping (n = 286) under both the infinite-site and infinite-allele models of population genetics. In addition to the many single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) present in all samples, there were 35 ``polymorphic''SNVs among samples. High genetic diversity was evident as the 23 WES samples defined 20 unique cell clones. With all 286 samples genotyped, clonal diversity agreed well with the non-Darwinian model with no evidence of positive Darwinian selection. Under the non-Darwinian model, MALL (the number of coding region mutations in the entire tumor) was estimated to be greater than 100 million in this tumor. DNA sequences reveal local diversities in small patches of cells and validate the estimation. In contrast, the genetic diversity under a Darwinian model would generally be orders of magnitude smaller. Because the level of genetic diversity will have implications on therapeutic resistance, non-Darwinian evolution should be heeded in cancer treatments even for microscopic tumors.},

@article{Escalante15,
	Abstract = {The metabolic capabilities of microbes are the basis for many major biotechnological advances, exploiting microbial diversity by selection or engineering of single strains. However, there are limits to the advances that can be achieved with single strains, and attention has turned toward the metabolic potential of consortia and the field of synthetic ecology. The main challenge for the synthetic ecology is that consortia are frequently unstable, largely because evolution by constituent members affects their interactions, which are the basis of collective metabolic functionality. Current practices in modeling consortia largely consider interactions as fixed circuits of chemical reactions, which greatly increases their tractability. This simplification comes at the cost of essential biological realism, stripping out the ecological context in which the metabolic actions occur and the potential for evolutionary change. In other words, evolutionary stability is not engineered into the system. This realization highlights the necessity to better identify the key components that influence the stable coexistence of microorganisms. Inclusion of ecological and evolutionary principles, in addition to biophysical variables and stoichiometric modeling of metabolism, is critical for microbial consortia design. This review aims to bring ecological and evolutionary concepts to the discussion on the stability of microbial consortia. In particular, we focus on the combined effect of spatial structure (connectivity of molecules and cells within the system) and ecological interactions (reciprocal and non-reciprocal) on the persistence of microbial consortia. We discuss exemplary cases to illustrate these ideas from published studies in evolutionary biology and biotechnology. We conclude by making clear the relevance of incorporating evolutionary and ecological principles to the design of microbial consortia, as a way of achieving evolutionarily stable and sustainable systems.},

Reverse evolution has been little studied in sexual populations12,13,14, even though the population genetics of sexual populations may be quite different. In the present study, 25 diverged replicated populations of Drosophila melanogaster are returned to a common ancestral environment for 50 generations. Here we show that reverse evolution back to the ancestral state occurs, but is not universal, instead depending on previous evolutionary history and the character studied. Hybrid populations showed no greater tendency to undergo successful reverse evolution, suggesting that insufficient genetic variation was not the factor limiting reverse evolution. Adaptive reverse evolution is a contingent process which occurs with only 50 generations of sexual reproduction.},

	Abstract = {Organismal modifications to their physical and chemical environment play a significant role in structuring many modern ecosystems, and experimental evidence suggests that such behavior can increase diversity. Despite the important role such activities play in connecting ecology and evolution, less is known of the macroevolutionary impact of such influences, especially their role during major evolutionary transitions. The Ediacaran-Cambrian diversification of Metazoa encompassed the appearance and early diversification of virtually all major clades of marine animals and the establishment of metazoan-dominated ecosystems. Here we assess the role of positive ecological feedbacks using a new compilation of the first occurrences of all metazoan phyla, classes; orders and equivalent stem taxa, as well as data from a previously published compendium on fossils from the early to middle Cambrian of China. The results reveal relatively minor feedback during the Ediacaran, but a substantial increase during the Cambrian, principally through bioturbation and the appearance of a number of structural engineers, including sponges. Chemical modification of the environment through filtering and bioturbation seems to have had the largest impact. Data on taxic diversity is a poor proxy for abundance, or for the actual environmental impact of these activities, however. Future assessments of the influence of ecological feedbacks on this event will require standardized assessments of the abundance of taxa with different ecological roles.},

Consistent with this idea, eusocial species of sponge-dwelling Synalpheus shrimps from Belize are ecological generalists with a broader host breadth and higher abundance than non-eusocial species. We evaluate whether sociality promotes ecological generalism (social conquest hypothesis) or whether ecological generalism facilitates the transition to sociality (social transition hypothesis) in 38 Synalpheus shrimp species. We find that sociality evolves primarily from host generalists, and almost exclusively so for transitions to eusociality. Additionally, sponge volume is more important for explaining social transitions towards communal breeding than to eusociality, suggesting that different ecological factors may influence the independent evolutionary origins of sociality in Synalpheus shrimps. Ultimately, our results are consistent with the social transition hypothesis and the idea that ecological generalism facilitates the transition to sociality.},

Instead, incipient workers and queens behave selfishly and are subject to direct natural selection. Beyond the eusociality threshold, relatedness enables ?soft inheritance? as the framework for initial adaptations of eusociality. At the threshold of irreversibility, queen and worker castes become fixed in advanced eusociality. Transitions from solitary to facultative, facultative to primitive, and primitive to advanced eusociality occur via exaptation, phenotypic accommodation and genetic assimilation. Multilevel selection characterizes the solitary to highly eusocial transition, but components of multilevel selection vary across levels of eusociality.

	Abstract = {Palaeontologists recognize five major extinction events from the fossil record, with the most recent, the Cretaceous mass extinction, ending some 65 million years ago. Given the many species known to have disappeared in the past few thousand years, some biologists suggest that a sixth such event is now under way. Barnosky et al. set out to review the evidence for that claim, and conclude that the recent loss of species is dramatic and serious, but not yet in the mass extinction category ---usually defined as a loss of at least 75{\%} of Earth's species in a geologically short time frame. But that said, there are clear indications that the loss of species now classed as 'critically endangered' would soon propel the world into its sixth mass extinction.},

	N2 = {Abstract:? The fossil record documents two mutually exclusive macroevolutionary modes separated by the transitional Ediacaran Period. Despite the early appearance of crown eukaryotes and an at least partially oxygenated atmosphere, the pre-Ediacaran biosphere was populated almost exclusively by microscopic organisms exhibiting low diversity, no biogeographical partitioning and profound morphological/evolutionary stasis. By contrast, the post-Ediacaran biosphere is characterized by large diverse organisms, bioprovinciality and conspicuously dynamic macroevolution. The difference can be understood in terms of the unique escalatory coevolution accompanying the early Ediacaran introduction of eumetazoans, followed by their early Cambrian (Tommotian) expansion into the pelagic realm. Eumetazoans reinvented the rules of macroecology through their invention of multitrophic food webs, large body size, life-history trade-offs, ecological succession, biogeography, major increases in standing biomass, eukaryote-dominated phytoplankton and the potential for mass extinction. Both the pre-Ediacaran and the post-Ediacaran biospheres were inherently stable, but the former derived from the simplicity of superabundant microbes exposed to essentially static, physical environments, whereas the latter is based on eumetazoan-induced diversity and dynamic, biological environments. The c.?100-myr Ediacaran transition (extending to the base of the Tommotian) can be defined on evolutionary criteria, and might usefully be incorporated into the Phanerozoic.},

@article{Schlichting95,
	Abstract = {The ideas of phenotypic plasticity and of reaction norm are gaining prominence as important components of theories of phenotypic evolution. Our understanding of the role of phenotypic plasticity as an adaptation of organisms to variable environments will depend on (1) the form(s) of genetic and developmental control exerted on the shape of the reaction norm and (2) the nature of the constraints on the possible evolutionary trajectories in multiple environments. In this paper we identify two categories of genetic control of plasticity: allelic sensitivity and gene regulation. These correspond generally to two classes of response by the developmental system to environmental change: phenotypic modulation, in which plastic responses are a continuous and proportional function of environmental stimuli and developmental conversion, where responses tend to be not simply proportional to the stimuli. We propose that control of plasticity by regulatory actions has distinct advantages over simple allelic sensitivity: stability of phenotypic expression, capacity for anticipatory response and relaxation of constraints due to genetic correlations. We cite examples of the extensive molecular evidence for the existence of environmentally-cued gene regulation leading to developmental conversion. The results of quantitative genetic investigations on the genetics and evolution of plasticity, as well as the limits of current approaches are discussed. We suggest that evolution of reaction norms would be affected by the ecological context (i.e. spatial versus temporal variation, hard versus soft selection, and fine versus coarse environmental grain). We conclude by discussing some empirical approaches to address fundamental questions about plasticity evolution.},

	N2 = {Abstract:? The long-term diversification of life probably cannot be modelled as a simple equilibrial process: the time scales are too long, the potential for exploring new ecospace is too large and it is unlikely that ecological controls can act at global scales. The sum of many clade expansions and reductions, each of which happens according to its own dynamic, probably approximates more a damped exponential curve when translated into a global-scale species diversification curve. Unfortunately, it is not possible to plot such a meaningful global-scale species diversification curve through time, but curves at higher taxonomic levels have been produced. These curves are subject to the vagaries of the fossil record, but it is unlikely that the sources of error entirely overwhelm the biological signal. Clades radiate when the external and internal conditions are right: a new territory or ecospace becomes available, and the lineage has acquired a number of characters that open up a new diet or mode of life. Modern high levels of diversity in certain speciose clades may depend on such ancient opportunities taken. Dramatic climatic changes through the Quaternary must have driven extinctions and originations, but many species responded simply by moving to more favourable locations. Ecological communities appear to be no more than merely chance associations of species, but there may be real interactions among species. Ironically, high species diversity may lead to more speciation, not, as had been assumed, less: more species create more opportunities and selective pressures for other species to respond to, rather than capping diversity at a fixed equilibrium level. Studies from the scale of modern ecosystems to global long-term patterns in the fossil record support a model for the exponential diversification of life, and one explanation for a pattern of exponential diversification is that as diversity increases, new forms become ever more refinements of existing forms. In a sense the world becomes increasingly divided into finer niche space. Organisms have a propensity to speciate freely, species richness within ecosystems appears to generate opportunities for more speciation, clades show all kinds of patterns from sluggish speciation rates and constant diversity through time to apparently explosive speciation, and there is no evidence that rapidly speciating clades have reached a limit, nor that they are driving other clades to extinction. A corollary of this view is that current biodiversity must be higher than it has ever been. Limits to infinite growth are clearly local, regional, and global turnover and extinction events, when climate change and physical catastrophes knock out species and whole clades, and push the rising exponential curve down a notch or two.},

Recent studies seeking biological explanations for this pattern have emphasized the role of niche differentiation, as in hypotheses of adaptive radiation and ecological limits to diversity. Yet many other biological explanations might underlie diversification slowdowns. In this paper, we focus on the geographic context of diversification, environment-driven bursts of speciation, failure of clades to keep pace with a changing environment, and protracted speciation. We argue that, despite being currently underemphasized, these alternatives represent biologically plausible explanations that should be considered along with niche differentiation. Testing the importance of these alternative hypotheses might yield fundamentally different explanations for what influences species richness within clades through time.},

	Abstract = {Much research has been devoted to identify the conditions under which selection favours flexible individuals or genotypes that are able to modify their growth, development and behaviour in response to environmental cues, to unravel the mechanisms of plasticity and to explore its influence on patterns of diversity among individuals, populations and species. The consequences of developmental plasticity and phenotypic flexibility for the performance and ecological success of populations and species have attracted a comparatively limited but currently growing interest. Here, I re-emphasize that an increased understanding of the roles of plasticity in these contexts requires a `whole organism'(rather than `single trait') approach, taking into consideration that organisms are integrated complex phenotypes. I further argue that plasticity and genetic polymorphism should be analysed and discussed within a common framework. I summarize predictions from theory on how phenotypic variation stemming from developmental plasticity and phenotypic flexibility may affect different aspects of population-level performance. I argue that it is important to distinguish between effects associated with greater interindividual phenotypic variation resulting from plasticity, and effects mediated by variation among individuals in the capacity to express plasticity and flexibility as such. Finally, I claim that rigorous testing of predictions requires methods that allow for quantifying and comparing whole organism plasticity, as well as the ability to experimentally manipulate the level of and capacity for developmental plasticity and phenotypic flexibility independent of genetic variation.},

The emergent metagenomic structure of communities is often quantitatively convergent in similar habitats, with highly similar fractions of the metagenome being devoted to the same metabolic pathways. By contrast, the species-level taxonomic composition is often highly variable even in replicate environments. The mechanisms behind these patterns are not yet understood. By studying the self-assembly of hundreds of communities in replicate, synthetic habitats, we show that the reproducibility of microbial community assembly reflects an emergent metabolic structure, which is quantitatively predictable from first-principles, genome-scale metabolic models. Taxonomic variability within functional groups arises through multistability in population dynamics, and the species-level community composition is predictably governed by the mutual competitive exclusion of two sub-dominant strains. Our findings provide a mechanistic bridge between microbial community structure at different levels of organization, and show that the evolutionary conservation of metabolic traits, both in terms of growth responses and niches constructed, can be leveraged to quantitatively predict the taxonomic and metabolic structure of microbial communities.},

	Abstract = {Animal social organization varies from complex societies where reproduction is dominated by a single individual (eusociality) to those where reproduction is more evenly distributed among group members (communal breeding). Yet, how simple groups transition evolutionarily to more complex societies remains unclear. Competing hypotheses suggest that eusociality and communal breeding are alternative evolutionary endpoints, or that communal breeding is an intermediate stage in the transition towards eusociality. We tested these alternative hypotheses in sponge-dwelling shrimps, Synalpheus spp. Although species varied continuously in reproductive skew, they clustered into pair-forming, communal and eusocial categories based on several demographic traits. Evolutionary transition models suggested that eusocial and communal species are discrete evolutionary endpoints that evolved independently from pair-forming ancestors along alternative paths. This 'family-centred' origin of eusociality parallels observations in insects and vertebrates, reinforcing the role of kin selection in the evolution of eusociality and suggesting a general model of animal social evolution.},

@article{Sherman95,
	Abstract = {Eusocial societies are traditionally characterized by a reproductive division of labor, an overlap of generations, and cooperative care of the breeders' young. Eusociality was once thought to occur only in termites, ants, and some bee and wasp species, but striking evolutionary convergences have recently become apparent between the societies of these insects and those of cooperatively breeding birds and mammals. These parallels have blurred distinctions between cooperative breeding and eusociality, leading to calls for either drastically restricting or expanding usage of these terms. We favor the latter approach. Cooperative breeding and eusociality are not discrete phenomena, but rather form a continuum of fundamentally similar social systems whose main differences lie in the distribution of lifetime reproductive success among group members. Therefore we propose to array vertebrate and invertebrate cooperative breeders along a common axis, representing a standardized measure of reproductive variance, and to drop such (loaded) terms as ``primitive''and ``advanced''eusociality. The terminology we propose unites all occurrences of alloparental helping of kin under a single theoretical umbrella (e.g., Hamilton's rule). Thus, cooperatively breeding vertebrates can be regarded as eusocial, just as eusocial invertebrates are cooperative breeders. We believe this integrated approach will foster potentially revealing cross-taxon comparisons, which are essential to understanding social evolution in birds, mammals, and insects.},

	N2 = {Summary 1. In Drosophila the great majority of mutations are reversible in direction, and very commonly the ?reverse mutation? appears to reconstitute precisely the original gene. The mutation from the normal to the abnormal type has been found usually to be a change from a more active to a less active condition of the gene, and is hence to be regarded as constituting, itself, a reversal of the original direction of evolution. The so-called reverse mutation, in such a case, is really a mutation in the direction of past evolution. As the latter changes usually occur less readily than the former (except in the rare cases of highly mutable mutant genes), it is to be inferred that evolution proceeded contrary to the prevailing mutation pressure, and hence only by the aid of selection. Thus, with selection relaxed, a certain reverse evolution would tend to occur, so far as individual loci were concerned. 2. The reversibility of most mutations is significant in the theory of the gene and of evolution in showing, first, that most mutations pre not mere losses of genes. Secondly, as Timof{\'e}{\"e}ff-Ressovsky, Zimmer and Delbr{\"u}ck (1935) have pointed out, the fact of their fairly high reversibility indicates that most mutations involve canalized reactions in a unified gene structure. For, in the case of radiation mutations at any rate, it can be shown that activation of any one of a large number of atoms, and of gene parts, results in sensibly the same mutation; that this principle applies even to reverse mutations indicates that precisely the same gene-part as was struck in making the original mutation need not be struck again to make the reversal. This adds to the already existing evidence (Muller, 1932) that the gene mutation process involves a chain of reactions of which the primary one may even have lain outside the gene. It is at present uncertain whether or not this process involves a breakage and linear rearrangement of the chromonema similar to that occurring in obvious gene rearrangements but much more minute. This conception, which might require a revision of older notions of distinctly delimited genes, seems however to meet with some difficulties in explaining the comparative readiness with which apparently exact reversions may be produced. 3. Considerations of mutation frequency show that a mere removal of selection for given genes would be attended by reversal of evolution, in the sense of loss of organs and of traits (e.g. pigmentation) dependent on organized reaction systems, in, geologically, a comparatively short time. In practice, there are difficulties in the way of such a stoppage of selection for given genes (or even for given alleles of them) inasmuch as there is a tendency for genes (and gene differences) to become increasingly pleiotropic in the course of evolution, through mutational transfer of functions. Stopping selection in respect to the major function of a gene, then, can only slowly, with a speed dependent on the recency with which the gene has acquired this function, lead to a genetic reversal, involving loss of this function. For such a process is now contingent upon the establishment of mutations in other genes, that accidentally happen to have the effect of taking over the secondary functions of the gene in question. Eventually, however, loss of any function must follow stoppage of selection for it, since an ever greater number of mutations must become established (both through selection for other functions, and through ?drift?) that happen to disturb the organized reaction system whereby the given function is carried out. 4. There can be apparent reversal of evolution with respect to given characters brought about by selection of mutations as well as by the genetic disintegration attendant upon mere removal of selection. But in neither case will the final product be genically identical or even very similar to the archetype. For the mutations of many different genes have equivalent end-effects, especially in the case of the ?small mutations?, which are more numerous and less harmful, and hence more apt to furnish evolutionary material than the large ones. For this reason the determination of the exact mutational path of evolution involves a large element of accident and, considered from a genic point of view, this path can never really be retraced, nor paralleled, in a second evolutionary sequence, nor can the same complex genic system be twice arrived at. The probability of the phenotypic similarity being thorough-going will depend, among other things, on the length and complexity of the path to be retraced (or paralleled), and on the extent to which the reverse (or parallel) selection applies to all features at once (as a departure in one respect will tend to influence the conditions for other features). 5. In the case of a longer, more complex path, there is an increasing role played by the complicating circumstance (mentioned in (3)) that some of the evolutionary steps have later acquired accessory functions that can no longer be dispensed with readily. At the same time their own genetic basis has spread so as to depend on an increasing number of genes, by a kind of genetic diffusion. These circumstances will often prevent even the appearance of retracement, so that an equivalent end-result (e.g. adoption of fish-like form by mammals) will obviously embody a quite different developmental mechanism or have a demonstrably different morphological or physiological basis. There will thus be a tendency for the old gene reactions of development and of physiology to persist in the basis of the life complex and only to be overlaid, as it were, by the newer acquirements, which would tend to develop later in ontogeny (recapitulation), and this principle would apply no matter whether these newer acquirements represented progressively different stages, or more or less phenotypic reversal to an earlier stage (a superficial reversion). Nevertheless, especially in the case of shorter paths (and more closely related organisms) there should often be the possibility both of parallel and reverse evolution involving a more nearly real retracement (forwards or backwards) of steps which, though genically somewhat different, embody essentially the same reaction changes, as judged from the point of view of ordinary embryology, physiology and morphology. For here the steps have not yet become so indispensable; moreover, the thousands of primary gene reactions are necessarily canalized into certain definite channels, that limit the possible effects of their change, as viewed by these methods, which still deal with characters standing relatively far from the gene itself. To some extent, then, reversal, as well as parallelism in evolution, maybe ?real?, and to deny the homologies of the resultant forms is to make an arbitrary metaphysical distinction, created to suit the point to be proved. 6. The complex systems of chemical reactions upon which fertility and viability depend become changed by numerous mutations, differing in different populations, that become established in, geologically, a very short time. Some of these mutations, though first indifferent or only an asset, finally become necessary, through the later establishment of other mutations, which without them would be detrimental to fertility or viability. Thereafter, crossing between one of the populations in question and one like the original (or one likewise evolved from the latter) will result in hybrids that are sterile or inviable, owing to the action of these harmful mutant genes, inadequately balanced by the ones that had made them tolerable. Two groups of organisms which are not ordinarily allowed to cross with one another will thus automatically become increasingly immiscible, and their genic, chemical paths of evolution will diverge more and more. This will occur even in cases where their evolution is, from the phenotypic standpoint, strikingly parallel (owing to similar selective conditions and similar developmental and physiological bases for change), or where one of the groups undergoes a striking appearance of reversion towards the other, and even though, in the case of more closely related groups, the parallelism or reversion may involve physiological and ontogenetic processes lying on a relatively deep plane of analysis. There must also be a hidden shift in the chemical, genic basis of a population which, phenotypically, remains relatively constant. But although these deeper-lying genic changes may for a long time remain cryptic, they will eventually find more and more expression in ?unnecessary? features of the life processes, discoverable by the chemist, the physiologist, the embryologist, or the morphologist, and an ever more different basis will be laid conditioning the future evolutionary possibilities.},

	Abstract = {AbstractGenotypes that hedge their bets can be favored by selection in an unpredictably varying environment. Bet hedging can be achieved by systematically expressing several phenotypes, such as one that readily attempts to reproduce and one that procrastinates in a dormant stage. But how much of each phenotype should a genotype express? Theory predicts that evolving bet-hedging strategies depend on local environmental variation, on how the population is regulated, and on exchanges with neighboring populations. Empirically, however, it remains unknown whether bet hedging can evolve to cope with the ecological conditions experienced by populations. Here we study the evolution of bet-hedging dormancy frequencies in two neighboring populations of the chestnut weevil, Curculio elephas. We estimate the temporal distribution of demographic parameters together with the form of the relationship between fecundity and population density and use both to parameterize models that predict the bet-hedging dormancy frequency expected to evolve in each population. Strikingly, the observed dormancy frequencies closely match predictions in their respective localities. We also found that dormancy frequencies vary randomly across generations, likely due to environmental perturbations of the underlying physiological mechanism. Using a model that includes these constraints, we predict the whole distribution of dormancy frequencies whose mean and shape agree with our observed data. Overall, our results suggest that dormancy frequencies have evolved according to local ecological conditions and physiological constraints.},

	N2 = {Abstract Evolution is often deemed irreversible. The evolution of complex traits that require many mutations makes their reversal unlikely. Even in simpler traits, reversals might become less likely as neutral or beneficial mutations, with deleterious effects in the ancestral context, become fixed in the novel background. This is especially true in changes that involve large reorganizations of the organism and its interactions with the environment. The evolution of multicellularity involves the reorganization of previously autonomous cells into a more complex organism; despite the complexity of this change, single cells have repeatedly evolved from multicellular ancestors. These repeated reversals to unicellularity undermine the generality of Dollo's law. In this article, we evaluated the dynamics of reversals to unicellularity from recently evolved multicellular phenotypes of the brewers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae. Even though multicellularity in this system evolved recently, it involves the evolution of new levels of selection. Strong selective pressures against multicellularity lead to rapid reversibility to single cells in all of our replicate lines, whereas counterselection favoring multicellularity led to minimal reductions to the rates of reversal. History and chance played an important role in the tempo and mode of reversibility, highlighting the interplay of deterministic and stochastic events in evolutionary reversals.},

Yet little is known about how large size evolves, particularly in nascent multicellular organisms that lack genetically-regulated multicellular development.

Over 600 daily transfers (\~{}3,000 generations), multicellular snowflake yeast evolved macroscopic size, becoming \~{}2·104 times larger (\~{}mm scale) and 104-fold more biophysically tough, while remaining clonal. They accomplished this through sustained biophysical adaptation, evolving increasingly elongate cells that initially reduced the strain of cellular packing, then facilitated branch entanglement so that groups of cells stay together even after many cellular bonds fracture. Four out of five replicate populations show evidence of predominantly adaptive evolution, with mutations becoming significantly enriched in genes affecting cell shape and cell-cell bonds. Taken together, this work shows how selection acting on the emergent properties of simple multicellular groups can drive sustained biophysical adaptation, an early step in the evolution of increasingly complex multicellular organisms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here we show a similar result for clonally reproducing bacteria, but which comes about for different reasons. In simulated microbial populations, there is an evolutionary tradeoff between early and late stages of niche adaptation, which is resolved when relatively few loci are required for adaptation. At early stages, recombination accelerates adaptation to new niches (ecological speciation) by combining multiple adaptive alleles into a single genome. Later on, without assortative mating or other barriers to gene flow, recombination generates unfit intermediate genotypes and homogenizes incipient species. The solution to this tradeoff may be simply to reduce the number of loci required for speciation, or to reduce recombination between species over time. Both solutions appear to be relevant in natural microbial populations, allowing them to diverge into ecological species under similar constraints as sexual eukaryotes, despite differences in their life histories.},

Phylogenomic analyses have placed the Asgard archaea as the closest prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes.Comparative genomic analyses have reconstructed a complex last eukaryotic common ancestor. However, how and in which order these complex eukaryotic features evolved in an Asgard archaea-related ancestor remains largely unclear.Genomic investigation of Asgard archaea showed that they carry several genes formerly believed to be eukaryotic specific, illuminating early events during eukaryogenesis.Fully understanding the process of eukaryogenesis requires finding answers to several challenging and intertwined questions.

	Abstract = {{$[$}Bacteria are profoundly different from eukaryotes in their patterns of genetic exchange. Nevertheless, ecological diversity is organized in the same way across all of life: individual organisms fall into more or less discrete clusters on the basis of their phenotypic, ecological, and DNA sequence characteristics. Each sequence cluster in the bacterial world appears to correspond to an "ecotype," defined as a population of cells in the same ecological niche, which would all be out-competed by any adaptive mutant coming from the population. Ecotypes, so defined, share many of the dynamic properties attributed to eukaryotic species: genetic diversity within an ecotype is limited by a force of cohesion (in this case, periodic selection); different ecotypes are free to diverge without constraint from one another; and ecotypes are ecologically distinct. Also, ecotypes can be discovered and classified as DNA sequence clusters, even when we are ignorant of their ecology. Owing to the rarity and promiscuity of bacterial genetic exchange, speciation in the bacterial world is expected to be much less constrained than in the world of animals and plants.{$]$}},

	Abstract = {AbstractThe social environment can affect development and fitness. However, we do not know how selection acts on individuals that cue developmental pathways using features of the social environment. Socially cued anticipatory plasticity (SCAP) is a hypothetical strategy whereby juveniles use social cues to alter development to match their adult phenotype to the social environment that they expect to encounter. While intuitively appealing, the evolution of such plasticity is a puzzle, because the cue changes when individuals use it. Can socially cued plasticity evolve when such a feedback occurs? We use individual-based simulations to model evolution of SCAP in an environment that fluctuates between favoring each of two discrete phenotypes. We found that socially cued plasticity evolved, but only when strong selection acted on survival rather than on fecundity differences between adult phenotypes. In this case, the social cue reliably predicted which phenotype would be favored on maturation. Surprisingly, costs to plasticity increased the range of conditions under which it was adaptive. In the absence of costs, evolution led to a state where SCAP individuals could not effectively respond to environmental changes. Costs to plasticity lowered the proportion of the population that used SCAP, which in turn increased the reliability of the social cue and allowed individuals that used socially cued plasticity to switch between the favored phenotypes more consistently. Our results suggest that the evolution of adaptive plasticity in response to social cues may represent a larger class of problems in which evolution is hard to predict because of feedbacks among critical processes.},

We identify a substantial shared core of genes upregulated in the abdomens of queen ants and honey bees that also tends to be upregulated in mated female flies, suggesting that these genes are part of a conserved insect reproductive groundplan. Outside of this shared groundplan, few genes are differentially expressed in common. Instead, the majority of the thousands of caste-associated genes are plastically expressed, rapidly evolving, and relatively evolutionarily young.

Microsporidia are thought to lack typical eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria and peroxisomes. This has been interpreted as support for the hypothesis that these peculiar eukaryotes diverged before the mitochondrial endosymbiosis, which would make them one of the earliest offshoots in eukaryotic evolution. But microsporidial nuclear genes that encode orthologues of typical mitochondrial heatshock Hsp70 proteins have been detected, which provides evidence for secondary loss of the organelle or endosymbiont. In addition, gene trees and more sophisticated phylogenetic analyses have recovered microsporidia as the relatives of fungi, rather than as basal eukaryotes. Here we show that a highly specific antibody raised against a Trachipleistophora hominis Hsp70 protein detects the presence, under light and electron microscopy, of numerous tiny ( approximately 50 x 90 nm) organelles with double membranes in this human microsporidial parasite. The finding of relictual mitochondria in microsporidia provides further evidence of the reluctance of eukaryotes to lose the mitochondrial organelle, even when its canonical function of aerobic respiration has been apparently lost.},

	Abstract = {The field studying unusual mitochondria in microbial eukaryotes has come full circle. Some 10-15 years ago it had the evangelical task of informing the wider scientific community that not all eukaryotes had mitochondria. Advances in the field indicated that although some protists might not have mitochondria, the presence of genes of mitochondrial ancestry suggested their lineage once had. The subsequent discovery of mitochondrial compartments in all supposedly amitochondriate protists studied so far indicates that all eukaryotes do have mitochondria indeed. This assertion has fuelled novel eukaryotic origin theories and weakened others. But what do we know about these unusual mitochondria from anaerobic protists? Have they all converged onto similar roles? Iron-sulphur cluster assembly is often hailed as the unifying feature of these organelles. However, the iron-sulphur protein that is so important that a complete organelle is being maintained has not been identified. Is it to be expected that all unusual mitochondria perform the same physiological role? These organelles have been found in numerous protists occupying different ecological niches. Different selection pressures operate on different organisms so there is no reason to suspect that their mitochondria should all be the same.},

	Abstract = {Hydrogenosomes are organelles that produce ATP and hydrogen, and are found in various unrelated eukaryotes, such as anaerobic flagellates, chytridiomycete fungi and ciliates. Although all of these organelles generate hydrogen, the hydrogenosomes from these organisms are structurally and metabolically quite different, just like mitochondria where large differences also exist. These differences have led to a continuing debate about the evolutionary origin of hydrogenosomes. Here we show that the hydrogenosomes of the anaerobic ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis, which thrives in the hindgut of cockroaches, have retained a rudimentary genome encoding components of a mitochondrial electron transport chain. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that those proteins cluster with their homologues from aerobic ciliates. In addition, several nucleus-encoded components of the mitochondrial proteome, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and complex II, were identified. The N. ovalis hydrogenosome is sensitive to inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and produces succinate as a major metabolic end product--biochemical traits typical of anaerobic mitochondria. The production of hydrogen, together with the presence of a genome encoding respiratory chain components, and biochemical features characteristic of anaerobic mitochondria, identify the N. ovalis organelle as a missing link between mitochondria and hydrogenosomes.},

We used integrative genomic analyses to explore the relationship between developmental and social plasticity in a bee species that can adopt either a social or solitary lifestyle. We find genes regulating this social flexibility also regulate development, and positive selection on these genes is influenced by their function during development. This suggests that developmental plasticity may influence the evolution of sociality. Our additional finding of genetic variants linked to differences in social behavior sheds light on how phenotypic variation derived from development may become encoded into the genome, and thus contribute to evolutionary change.Developmental plasticity generates phenotypic variation, but how it contributes to evolutionary change is unclear. Phenotypes of individuals in caste-based (eusocial) societies are particularly sensitive to developmental processes, and the evolutionary origins of eusociality may be rooted in developmental plasticity of ancestral forms. We used an integrative genomics approach to evaluate the relationships among developmental plasticity, molecular evolution, and social behavior in a bee species (Megalopta genalis) that expresses flexible sociality, and thus provides a window into the factors that may have been important at the evolutionary origins of eusociality. We find that differences in social behavior are derived from genes that also regulate sex differentiation and metamorphosis. Positive selection on social traits is influenced by the function of these genes in development. We further identify evidence that social polyphenisms may become encoded in the genome via genetic changes in regulatory regions, specifically in transcription factor binding sites. Taken together, our results provide evidence that developmental plasticity provides the substrate for evolutionary novelty and shapes the selective landscape for molecular evolution in a major evolutionary innovation: Eusociality.},

	Abstract = {We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the species, species groups, and subgenera within the predominantly eusocial lineage of Lasioglossum (the Hemihalictus series) based on three protein coding genes: mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I, nuclear elongation factor 1alpha and long-wavelength rhodopsin. The entire data set consisted of 3421 aligned nucleotide sites, 854 of which were parsimony informative. Analyses by equal weights parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods yielded good resolution among the 53 taxa/populations, with strong bootstrap support and high posterior probabilities for most nodes. There was no significant incongruence among genes, and parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods yielded congruent results. We mapped social behavior onto the resulting tree for 42 of the taxa/populations to infer the likely history of social evolution within Lasioglossum. Our results indicate that eusociality had a single origin within Lasioglossum. Within the predominantly eusocial clade, however, there have been multiple (six) reversals from eusociality to solitary nesting, social polymorphism, or social parasitism, suggesting that these reversals may be more common in primitively eusocial Hymenoptera than previously anticipated. Our results support the view that eusociality is hard to evolve but easily lost. This conclusion is potentially important for understanding the early evolution of the advanced eusocial insects, such as ants, termites, and corbiculate bees.},

By reverse evolution, we mean a scenario where selection is reversed. In this work, we use evolution (and reversal from) of multicellularity in S. cerevisiae as a model to answer this question. When selected for fast-settling variants, multicellularity evolves rapidly in the organism. On reversing selection, unicellularity evolves from the multicellular clusters. However, the dynamic trajectories of the two processes are different. In this context, evolution is not reversed dynamically at a phenotypic level. The phenotypic reversal is not driven by reversal of the original mutations during the forward evolution. Overall, our results show that the dynamics of molecular and phenotypic trajectories of evolution are distinct, and reversal of selection leads to unique trajectories of phenotypic reversal.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	Abstract = {Theoretical reasoning suggests that cancer may result from a knockdown of the genetic constraints that evolved for the maintenance of metazoan multicellularity. By characterizing the whole-life history of a xenograft tumour, here we show that metastasis is driven by positive selection for general loss-of-function mutations on multicellularity-related genes. Expression analyses reveal mainly downregulation of multicellularity-related genes and an evolving expression profile towards that of embryonic stem cells, the cell type resembling unicellular life in its capacity of unlimited clonal proliferation. Also, the emergence of metazoan multicellularity \~{}600 Myr ago is accompanied by an elevated birth rate of cancer genes, and there are more loss-of-function tumour suppressors than activated oncogenes in a typical tumour. These data collectively suggest that cancer represents a loss-of-function-driven reverse evolution back to the unicellular `ground state'. This cancer evolution model may account for inter-/intratumoural genetic heterogeneity, could explain distant-organ metastases and hold implications for cancer therapy.},

Understanding how such communities assemble and stabilize is important in a range of contexts, from biotechnological applications to what happens in our guts. Goldford et al. sampled the microbial communities from soil and plants containing hundreds to thousands of sequence variants. The organisms were passaged after culture in low concentrations of single carbon sources and were cross-fed with each other's metabolites; then, the resulting communities were sequenced using 16S ribosomal RNA, and the outcomes were modeled mathematically. The mix of species that survived under steady conditions converged reproducibly to reflect the experimentally imposed conditions rather than the mix of species initially inoculated---although at coarse phylogenetic levels, taxonomic patterns persisted.Science, this issue p. 469A major unresolved question in microbiome research is whether the complex taxonomic architectures observed in surveys of natural communities can be explained and predicted by fundamental, quantitative principles. Bridging theory and experiment is hampered by the multiplicity of ecological processes that simultaneously affect community assembly in natural ecosystems. We addressed this challenge by monitoring the assembly of hundreds of soil- and plant-derived microbiomes in well-controlled minimal synthetic media. Both the community-level function and the coarse-grained taxonomy of the resulting communities are highly predictable and governed by nutrient availability, despite substantial species variability. By generalizing classical ecological models to include widespread nonspecific cross-feeding, we show that these features are all emergent properties of the assembly of large microbial communities, explaining their ubiquity in natural microbiomes.},

	Abstract = {Atmospheric oxygen is thought to have played a vital role in the evolution of large, complex multicellular organisms. Challenging the prevailing theory, we show that the transition from an anaerobic to an aerobic world can strongly suppress the evolution of macroscopic multicellularity. Here we select for increased size in multicellular `snowflake'yeast across a range of metabolically-available O2 levels. While yeast under anaerobic and high-O2 conditions evolved to be considerably larger, intermediate O2 constrained the evolution of large size. Through sequencing and synthetic strain construction, we confirm that this is due to O2-mediated divergent selection acting on organism size. We show via mathematical modeling that our results stem from nearly universal evolutionary and biophysical trade-offs, and thus should apply broadly. These results highlight the fact that oxygen is a double-edged sword: while it provides significant metabolic advantages, selection for efficient use of this resource may paradoxically suppress the evolution of macroscopic multicellular organisms.},

	Abstract = {At the origin of multicellularity, cells may have evolved aggregation in response to predation, for functional specialisation or to allow large-scale integration of environmental cues. These group-level properties emerged from the interactions between cells in a group, and determined the selection pressures experienced by these cells. We investigate the evolution of multicellularity with an evolutionary model where cells search for resources by chemotaxis in a shallow, noisy gradient. Cells can evolve their adhesion to others in a periodically changing environment, where a cell's fitness solely depends on its distance from the gradient source. We show that multicellular aggregates evolve because they perform chemotaxis more efficiently than single cells. Only when the environment changes too frequently, a unicellular state evolves which relies on cell dispersal. Both strategies prevent the invasion of the other through interference competition, creating evolutionary bi-stability. Therefore, collective behaviour can be an emergent selective driver for undifferentiated multicellularity.},

	Abstract = {Developmental plasticity describes situations where a specific input during an individual's development produces a lasting alteration in phenotype. Some instances of developmental plasticity may be adaptive, meaning that the tendency to produce the phenotype conditional on having experienced the developmental input has been under positive selection. We discuss the necessary assumptions and predictions of hypotheses concerning adaptive developmental plasticity (ADP) and develop guidelines for how to test empirically whether a particular example is adaptive. Central to our analysis is the distinction between two kinds of ADP: informational, where the developmental input provides information about the future environment, and somatic state-based, where the developmental input enduringly alters some aspect of the individual's somatic state. Both types are likely to exist in nature, but evolve under different conditions. In all cases of ADP, the expected fitness of individuals who experience the input and develop the phenotype should be higher than that of those who experience the input and do not develop the phenotype, while the expected fitness of those who do not experience the input and do not develop the phenotype should be higher than those who do not experience the input and do develop the phenotype. We describe ancillary predictions that are specific to just one of the two types of ADP and thus distinguish between them.},

	Abstract = {The study of the association between fitness and reaction norms is of primary importance given the hypothesized role for phenotypic plasticity in shaping evolutionary patterns: in microevolution, as one mechanism for maintaining genetic variation, and in macroevolution, as a means of generating phenotypic novelties. In a glasshouse experiment, we investigated variation in reaction norms to nutrient availability in populations of Arabidopsis thaliana, and the relationship between this variation and reproductive fitness. We found evidence for across-treatment directional selection on the means for leaf number, flowering time, plant height, branching and growth rate; across-treatment stabilizing selection was detected for growth rate; and across-treatment disruptive selection was significant for leaf number. We also uncovered selection on the plasticity of some traits: directional for the plasticity of branching, and stabilizing for the plasticity of both branching and growth rate. When the two environments were considered separately, directional selection for height was detected under low nutrients; under high nutrients, we found evidence for directional selection on leaf number and height, and for disruptive selection on flowering time. The genetic correlation between a trait's expression in one environment and its expression in the alternate environment was positive and highly significant only for flowering time and growth rate. A principal components analysis revealed possible constraints on future selection responses, because of correlations among character means and among character plasticities.},

	Abstract = {Alternanthera philoxeroides is an amphibious invasive weed that can colonize both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Individuals growing in different habitats exhibit extensive phenotypic variation but little genetic differentiation. Little is known about the molecular basis underlying environment-induced phenotypic changes. Variation in transcript abundance in A. philoxeroides was characterized throughout the time-courses of pond and upland treatments using RNA-Sequencing. Seven thousand eight hundred and five genes demonstrated variable expression in response to different treatments, forming 11 transcriptionally coordinated gene groups. Functional enrichment analysis of plastically expressed genes revealed pathway changes in hormone-mediated signaling, osmotic adjustment, cell wall remodeling, and programmed cell death, providing a mechanistic understanding of the biological processes underlying the phenotypic changes in A. philoxeroides. Both transcriptional modulation of environmentally sensitive loci and environmentally dependent control of regulatory loci influenced the plastic responses to the environment. Phenotypic responses and gene expression patterns to contrasting hydrological conditions were compared between A. philoxeroides and its alien congener Alternanthera pungens. The terricolous A. pungens displayed limited phenotypic plasticity to different treatments. It was postulated based on gene expression comparison that the interspecific variation in plasticity between A. philoxeroides and A. pungens was not due to environmentally-mediated changes in hormone levels but to variations in the type and relative abundance of different signal transducers and receptors expressed in the target tissue.},

	Abstract = {High levels of inherited variation are observed for most traits and in most populations. Variation is maintained partly by mutation and partly by a balance of selective forces; however, we do not know the relative importance of these alternatives. This variation allows a rapid response to natural and artificial selection. Newly arising mutations make an important contribution to long-term selection response. Selection response in large experimental populations often continues steadily for many generations, indicating that many genetic loci are involved. Understanding the maintenance of variation, and the response to selection, requires that the sequence changes that cause trait differences be identified. This is challenging, because variation might depend on multiple alleles that include several interacting sites. Population genetics makes predictions about the nature of quantitative trait loci (QTL). For example, balancing selection is expected to maintain alleles at high frequency, whereas mutation is likely to maintain rare alleles. Predictions for the way that alleles interact, and for the size of their effects, depend on assumptions about the relationship between genotype and phenotype. One simple model indicates that QTL effects should be exponentially distributed.},

@article{Mackay09,
	Abstract = {Most phenotypic variation in natural populations is attributable to multiple interacting loci, with allelic effects that are sensitive to the exact environmental conditions each individual experiences. The underlying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) can be mapped by linkage to polymorphic marker loci with clear Mendelian segregation such as molecular polymorphisms.QTLs can be mapped in families or segregating progeny of crosses between genetically divergent strains (linkage mapping) or in unrelated individuals from the same population (association mapping). In both cases, large numbers of individuals are needed to detect and localize QTLs; the number of individuals and genotypes per individual needed increases as the QTL effect size decreases and the precision of localization increases.Positional cloning is the gold standard of identifying genes that correspond to QTLs. Corroborating evidence that a gene causes the variation in the trait of interest includes replication in independent studies, identifying potentially functional DNA polymorphisms between alternative alleles of one of the candidate genes, showing a difference in mRNA expression levels between genotypes, showing that mRNA or protein is expressed in tissues that are thought to be relevant to the trait, and showing that mutations in candidate genes affect the trait or fail to complement QTL alleles.Results of QTL mapping efforts in many species over the past 20 years have showed that there are key common features of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits: many loci with small effects are responsible for most quantitative genetic variation, these loci are often unexpected based on prior knowledge of the trait or correspond to computationally predicted genes; the effects of QTL alleles are highly context-dependent and vary depending on genetic background, environment and sex; and pleiotropic QTL effects are widespread.Despite 20 years of intensive effort, we have fallen short of our long-term goal of explaining genetic variation for quantitative traits in terms of the underlying genes, the effects of segregating alleles in different genetic backgrounds and in a range of ecologically relevant environments, as well as their effects on other traits, the molecular basis of functional allelic effects and the population frequency of causal variants. The challenge of dissecting quantitative traits into individual genes and their causal molecular polymorphisms will be solved in the near future by applying new sequencing and genotyping technologies to the problem, in combination with new community resources.Understanding the biological context in which molecular polymorphisms elicit their effects on trait variation requires knowledge of the effects of the polymorphisms on complex networks of transcriptional, protein, metabolic and other molecular endophenotypes that lead to the organismal phenotype. This is the province of the emerging discipline of systems genetics.Systems genetics integrates DNA sequence variation, variation in transcript abundance and other molecular phenotypes, and variation in organismal phenotypes in a linkage or association mapping population and enables us to interpret quantitative genetic variation in terms of biologically meaningful causal networks of correlated transcripts. The association of molecular variation with organismal phenotypes identifies QTLs, the association of molecular variation with gene expression traits identifies expression QTLs and correlations between gene expression and organismal level phenotypes identify quantitative trait transcripts.Levels of expression of many transcripts covary between individuals in a mapping population; the correlated transcripts can be grouped statistically into modules, in which each module consists of transcripts with higher correlations to each other than to the rest of the transcriptome. The correlations between transcripts in a module can be visualized graphically as a network with nodes denoting transcripts and edges connecting nodes that are genetically correlated. Causal biological networks can be derived from coexpression transcriptional networks that are also correlated with the phenotype of an organism, using the statistical concept of conditional dependence. The statistical definition of the molecular interactions that govern phenotypic variation through natural genetic perturbations is a testable hypothesis that can be validated and refined by functional studies.},

	N2 = {Abstract Life on land today is as much as 25 times as diverse as life in the sea. Paradoxically, this extraordinarily high level of continental biodiversity has been achieved in a shorter time and it occupies a much smaller area of the Earth's surface than does marine biodiversity. Raw palaeontological data suggest very different models for the diversification of life on land and in the sea. The well-studied marine fossil record appears to show evidence for an equilibrium model of diversification, with phases of rapid radiation, followed by plateaux that may indicate times of equilibrium diversity. The continental fossil record shows exponential diversification from the Silurian to the present. These differences appear to be real: the continental fossil record is unlikely to be so poor that all evidence for a high initial equilibrial diversity has been lost. In addition, it is not clear that the apparently equilibrial marine model is correct, since it is founded on studies at familial level. At species level, a logistic family-level curve probably breaks down to an exponential. The rocketing diversification rates of flowering plants, insects, and other land life are evidently hugely different from the more sluggish rates of diversification of life in the sea, perhaps as a result of greater endemism and habitat complexity on land.

	Abstract = {Between 85{\%} and 95{\%} of all living macroscopic species are found on land; the rest are mainly marine. We argue that the extraordinary diversity on land is geologically recent, dating from the mid-Cretaceous period, ∼110 million years ago. We suggest that the ability and necessity to be rare---that is, to maintain populations at low density---are made possible by the low cost of mobility of consumers on land, and that rarity is critical to the attainment of high-terrestrial diversity. Increasing productivity beginning in the mid-Cretaceous led to an increase in the survival of populations at low density and to an increase in the intensity of selection for that ability as well as for high mobility and habitat specialization. The pre-eminence of terrestrial, as compared to marine, diversity is therefore an historical phenomenon that is best explained by selection-related changes in mobility, dispersibility, and the evolution of partnerships.},

	Abstract = {A large proportion of existing species ---possibly half, conceivably even more ---may be lost within the foreseeable future. But this may not prove to be the most consequential outcome of the current biodiversity crisis. More significant could be the disruption and degradation of several basic processes of evolution. It appears likely that for mass extinction episodes (MEEs) in the geological past, the recovery period usually lasted at least five million years. Because of certain unique features of the present MEE ---notably the near elimination of biomes such as tropical forests, wetlands and coral reefs, which have served as `powerhouses'of evolution in the past ---the `bounce-back'phase could extend several times longer than five million years. Among distinctive features of future evolution could be; in the short term, homogenization of biotas, a proliferation of opportunistic species, an outburst of speciation among particular taxa, and a pest-and-weed ecology; and, in the long term, a decline of biodisparity, the elimination of megavertebrates, an end to speciation among large vertebrates, and multiple constraints on origination, innovation and adaptive radiation. These disruptive phenomena would rank among the most prominent departures in the entire course of evolution. Full knowledge and understanding of what may characterize future evolution remains largely a black hole of research. As a consequence, conservation policies fail to reflect a further problem of the biodiversity prospect, perhaps exceeding the better recognized problem of the mass extinction of species.},

One solution is the evolution of sensing mechanisms allowing modulation of the phenotype in response to specific cues. A simpler alternative is stochastic or random phenotype switching ---'hedging your bets'. A study of Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria exposed to a fluctuating regime with similarities to environments such as the vertebrate immune system demonstrates the evolution of bet-hedging behaviour in real time. The P. fluorescens strain evolved the capacity to switch randomly between colony types, ensuring survival in an artificial environment that constantly favoured different colonies. The presence of bet hedging in these simple organisms, and the identification of the mutations involved, show how a changing environment can reward risk-spreading behaviour. Such strategies may have been among the earliest evolutionary solutions to life in fluctuating environments.},

	Abstract = {Enzyme kinetics are fundamental to an understanding of cellular metabolism and for crafting synthetic biology applications. For decades, enzyme characterization has been based on in vitro enzyme assays. However, kinetic parameters are only available for <10{\%} of reactions, and this data scarcity limits the predictive power of metabolic models. Here we review recent studies that leverage quantitative proteomics to gain insight into in vivo enzyme kinetics. We discuss findings on the relationship between in vivo and in vitro enzyme catalysis and show how proteomics can be used to characterize the efficiency of enzyme utilization across conditions. Lastly, the efficient use of enzymes is shown to rationalize preference for low energy-yield metabolic strategies, such as aerobic fermentation at high growth rate.},

	Abstract = {Model organisms are often used in biological, medical and environmental research. Among insects, Drosophila melanogaster, Galleria mellonella, Apis mellifera, Bombyx mori, Periplaneta americana, and Locusta migratoria are often used. However, new model organisms still appear. In recent years, an increasing number of insect species has been suggested as model organisms in life sciences research due to their worldwide distribution and environmental significance, the possibility of extrapolating research studies to vertebrates and the relatively low cost of rearing. Beetles are the largest insect order, with their representative -- Tribolium castaneum -- being the first species with a completely sequenced genome, and seem to be emerging as new potential candidates for model organisms in various studies. Apart from T. castaneum, additional species representing various Coleoptera families, such as Nicrophorus vespilloides, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Coccinella septempunctata, Poecilus cupreus, Tenebrio molitor and many others, have been used. They are increasingly often included in two major research aspects: biomedical and environmental studies. Biomedical studies focus mainly on unraveling mechanisms of basic life processes, such as feeding, neurotransmission or activity of the immune system, as well as on elucidating the mechanism of different diseases (neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, metabolic, or immunological) using beetles as models. Furthermore, pharmacological bioassays for testing novel biologically active substances in beetles have also been developed. It should be emphasized that beetles are a source of compounds with potential antimicrobial and anticancer activity. Environmental-based studies focus mainly on the development and testing of new potential pesticides of both chemical and natural origin. Additionally, beetles are used as food or for their valuable supplements. Different beetle families are also used as bioindicators. Another important research area using beetles as models is behavioral ecology studies, for instance, parental care. In this paper, we review the current knowledge regarding beetles as model organisms and their practical application in various fields of life science.},

Using a model marine invertebrate, we created experimental field populations that varied in metabolic rate but not body size. We show that metabolism qualitatively affects population growth and carrying capacity in ways predicted by theory but that scaling relationships for these parameters, as well as estimates of energy use at carrying capacity, depart from classic predictions. That metabolism affects demography in ways that depart from canonical theory has important implications for predicting how populations may respond to global change and size-selective harvesting.Metabolism should drive demography by determining the rates of both biological work and resource demand. Long-standing ``rules''for how metabolism should covary with demography permeate biology, from predicting the impacts of climate change to managing fisheries. Evidence for these rules is almost exclusively indirect and in the form of among-species comparisons, while direct evidence is exceptionally rare. In a manipulative field experiment on a sessile marine invertebrate, we created experimental populations that varied in population size (density) and metabolic rate, but not body size. We then tested key theoretical predictions regarding relationships between metabolism and demography by parameterizing population models with lifetime performance data from our field experiment. We found that populations with higher metabolisms had greater intrinsic rates of increase and lower carrying capacities, in qualitative accordance with classic theory. We also found important departures from theory---in particular, carrying capacity declined less steeply than predicted, such that energy use at equilibrium increased with metabolic rate, violating the long-standing axiom of energy equivalence. Theory holds that energy equivalence emerges because resource supply is assumed to be independent of metabolic rate. We find this assumption to be violated under real-world conditions, with potentially far-reaching consequences for the management of biological systems.Quantitative data have been deposited in Dryad (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vhhmgqntv) (54).},

In losing their autonomy, endosymbionts lost the bulk of their genomes, necessitating the evolution of elaborate mechanisms for organelle biogenesis and metabolite exchange. In the process, symbionts acquired many host-derived properties, lost much of their eubacterial identity, and were transformed into extraordinarily diverse organelles that reveal complex histories that we are only beginning to decipher.},

	Abstract = {Since the late 1970s, determining the phylogenetic relationships among the contemporary domains of life, the Archaea (archaebacteria), Bacteria (eubacteria), and Eucarya (eukaryotes), has been central to the study of early cellular evolution. The two salient issues surrounding the universal tree of life are whether all three domains are monophyletic (i.e., all equivalent in taxanomic rank) and where the root of the universal tree lies. Evaluation of the status of the Archaea has become key to answering these questions. This review considers our cumulative knowledge about the Archaea in relationship to the Bacteria and Eucarya. Particular attention is paid to the recent use of molecular phylogenetic approaches to reconstructing the tree of life. In this regard, the phylogenetic analyses of more than 60 proteins are reviewed and presented in the context of their participation in major biochemical pathways. Although many gene trees are incongruent, the majority do suggest a sisterhood between Archaea and Eucarya. Altering this general pattern of gene evolution are two kinds of potential interdomain gene transferrals. One horizontal gene exchange might have involved the gram-positive Bacteria and the Archaea, while the other might have occurred between proteobacteria and eukaryotes and might have been mediated by endosymbiosis.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the evolution of eukaryotic cellular complexity is one of the grand challenges of modern biology. It has now been firmly established that mitochondria and plastids, the classical membrane-bound organelles of eukaryotic cells, evolved from bacteria by endosymbiosis. In the case of mitochondria, evidence points very clearly to an endosymbiont of α-proteobacterial ancestry. The precise nature of the host cell that partnered with this endosymbiont is, however, very much an open question. And while the host for the cyanobacterial progenitor of the plastid was undoubtedly a fully-fledged eukaryote, how - and how often - plastids moved from one eukaryote to another during algal diversification is vigorously debated. In this article I frame modern views on endosymbiotic theory in a historical context, highlighting the transformative role DNA sequencing played in solving early problems in eukaryotic cell evolution, and posing key unanswered questions emerging from the age of comparative genomics.},

	Abstract = {'On the Origin of Mitosing Cells' heralded a new way of seeing cellular evolution, with symbiosis at its heart. Lynn Margulis (then Sagan) marshalled an impressive array of evidence for endosymbiosis, from cell biology to atmospheric chemistry and Earth history. Despite her emphasis on symbiosis, she saw plenty of evidence for gradualism in eukaryotic evolution, with multiple origins of mitosis and sex, repeated acquisitions of plastids, and putative evolutionary intermediates throughout the microbial world. Later on, Margulis maintained her view of multiple endosymbioses giving rise to other organelles such as hydrogenosomes, in keeping with the polyphyletic assumptions of the serial endosymbiosis theory. She stood at the threshold of the phylogenetic era, and anticipated its potential. Yet while predicting that the nucleotide sequences of genes would enable a detailed reconstruction of eukaryotic evolution, Margulis did not, and could not, imagine the radically different story that would eventually emerge from comparative genomics. The last eukaryotic common ancestor now seems to have been essentially a modern eukaryotic cell that had already evolved mitosis, meiotic sex, organelles and endomembrane systems. The long search for missing evolutionary intermediates has failed to turn up a single example, and those discussed by Margulis turn out to have evolved reductively from more complex ancestors. Strikingly, Margulis argued that all eukaryotes had mitochondria in her 1967 paper (a conclusion that she later disavowed). But she developed her ideas in the context of atmospheric oxygen and aerobic respiration, neither of which is consistent with more recent geological and phylogenetic findings. Instead, a modern synthesis of genomics and bioenergetics points to the endosymbiotic restructuring of eukaryotic genomes in relation to bioenergetic membranes as the singular event that permitted the evolution of morphological complexity.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: All complex life on Earth is eukaryotic. All eukaryotic cells share a common ancestor that arose just once in four billion years of evolution. Prokaryotes show no tendency to evolve greater morphological complexity, despite their metabolic virtuosity. Here I argue that the eukaryotic cell originated in a unique prokaryotic endosymbiosis, a singular event that transformed the selection pressures acting on both host and endosymbiont. RESULTS: The reductive evolution and specialisation of endosymbionts to mitochondria resulted in an extreme genomic asymmetry, in which the residual mitochondrial genomes enabled the expansion of bioenergetic membranes over several orders of magnitude, overcoming the energetic constraints on prokaryotic genome size, and permitting the host cell genome to expand (in principle) over 200,000-fold. This energetic transformation was permissive, not prescriptive; I suggest that the actual increase in early eukaryotic genome size was driven by a heavy early bombardment of genes and introns from the endosymbiont to the host cell, producing a high mutation rate. Unlike prokaryotes, with lower mutation rates and heavy selection pressure to lose genes, early eukaryotes without genome-size limitations could mask mutations by cell fusion and genome duplication, as in allopolyploidy, giving rise to a proto-sexual cell cycle. The side effect was that a large number of shared eukaryotic basal traits accumulated in the same population, a sexual eukaryotic common ancestor, radically different to any known prokaryote. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of massive bioenergetic expansion, release from genome-size constraints, and high mutation rate favoured a protosexual cell cycle and the accumulation of eukaryotic traits. These factors explain the unique origin of eukaryotes, the absence of true evolutionary intermediates, and the evolution of sex in eukaryotes but not prokaryotes.

	Abstract = {For over 100 years, endosymbiotic theories have figured in thoughts about the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. More than 20 different versions of endosymbiotic theory have been presented in the literature to explain the origin of eukaryotes and their mitochondria. Very few of those models account for eukaryotic anaerobes. The role of energy and the energetic constraints that prokaryotic cell organization placed on evolutionary innovation in cell history has recently come to bear on endosymbiotic theory. Only cells that possessed mitochondria had the bioenergetic means to attain eukaryotic cell complexity, which is why there are no true intermediates in the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition. Current versions of endosymbiotic theory have it that the host was an archaeon (an archaebacterium), not a eukaryote. Hence the evolutionary history and biology of archaea increasingly comes to bear on eukaryotic origins, more than ever before. Here, we have compiled a survey of endosymbiotic theories for the origin of eukaryotes and mitochondria, and for the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus, summarizing the essentials of each and contrasting some of their predictions to the observations. A new aspect of endosymbiosis in eukaryote evolution comes into focus from these considerations: the host for the origin of plastids was a facultative anaerobe.},

	Abstract = {What are species? How do they arise? These questions are not easy to answer and have been particularly controversial in microbiology. Yet, for those microbiologists studying environmental questions or dealing with clinical issues, the ability to name and recognize species, widely considered the fundamental units of ecology, can be practically useful. On a more fundamental level, the speciation problem, the focus here, is more mechanistic and conceptual. What is the origin of microbial species, and what evolutionary and ecological mechanisms keep them separate once they begin to diverge? To what extent are these mechanisms universal across diverse types of microbes, and more broadly across the entire the tree of life? Here, we propose that microbial speciation must be viewed in light of gene flow, which defines units of genetic similarity, and of natural selection, which defines units of phenotype and ecological function. We discuss to what extent ecological and genetic units overlap to form cohesive populations in the wild, based on recent evolutionary modeling and population genomics studies. These studies suggest a continuous "speciation spectrum," which microbial populations traverse in different ways depending on their balance of gene flow and natural selection.},

@article{Schloss16,
	Abstract = {A census is typically carried out for people across a range of geographical levels; however, microbial ecologists have implemented a molecular census of bacteria and archaea by sequencing their 16S rRNA genes. We assessed how well the census of full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences is proceeding in the context of recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies because full-length sequences are typically used as references for classification of the short sequences generated by newer technologies. Among the 1,411,234 and 53,546 full-length bacterial and archaeal sequences, 94.5% and 95.1% of the bacterial and archaeal sequences, respectively, belonged to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that have been observed more than once. Although these metrics suggest that the census is approaching completion, 29.2% of the bacterial and 38.5% of the archaeal OTUs have been observed more than once. Thus, there is still considerable diversity to be explored. Unfortunately, the rate of new full-length sequences has been declining, and new sequences are primarily being deposited by a small number of studies. Furthermore, sequences from soil and aquatic environments, which are known to be rich in bacterial diversity, represent only 7.8 and 16.5% of the census, while sequences associated with host-associated environments represent 55.0% of the census. Continued use of traditional approaches and new technologies such as single-cell genomics and short-read assembly are likely to improve our ability to sample rare OTUs if it is possible to overcome this sampling bias. The success of ongoing efforts to use short-read sequencing to characterize archaeal and bacterial communities requires that researchers strive to expand the depth and breadth of this census. IMPORTANCE: The biodiversity contained within the bacterial and archaeal domains dwarfs that of the eukaryotes, and the services these organisms provide to the biosphere are critical. Surprisingly, we have done a relatively poor job of formally tracking the quality of the biodiversity as represented in full-length 16S rRNA genes. By understanding how this census is proceeding, it is possible to suggest the best allocation of resources for advancing the census. We found that the ongoing effort has done an excellent job of sampling the most abundant organisms but struggles to sample the rarer organisms. Through the use of new sequencing technologies, we should be able to obtain full-length sequences from these rare organisms. Furthermore, we suggest that by allocating more resources to sampling environments known to have the greatest biodiversity, we will be able to make significant advances in our characterization of archaeal and bacterial diversity.},

@article{Louca19,
	Abstract = {The global diversity of Bacteria and Archaea, the most ancient and most widespread forms of life on Earth, is a subject of intense controversy. This controversy stems largely from the fact that existing estimates are entirely based on theoretical models or extrapolations from small and biased data sets. Here, in an attempt to census the bulk of Earth's bacterial and archaeal ("prokaryotic") clades and to estimate their overall global richness, we analyzed over 1.7 billion 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequences in the V4 hypervariable region obtained from 492 studies worldwide, covering a multitude of environments and using multiple alternative primers. From this data set, we recovered 739,880 prokaryotic operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 16S-V4 gene clusters at 97{\%} similarity), a commonly used measure of microbial richness. Using several statistical approaches, we estimate that there exist globally about 0.8-1.6 million prokaryotic OTUs, of which we recovered somewhere between 47{\%}-96{\%}, representing >99.98{\%} of prokaryotic cells. Consistent with this conclusion, our data set independently "recaptured" 91{\%}-93{\%} of 16S sequences from multiple previous global surveys, including PCR-independent metagenomic surveys. The distribution of relative OTU abundances is consistent with a log-normal model commonly observed in larger organisms; the total number of OTUs predicted by this model is also consistent with our global richness estimates. By combining our estimates with the ratio of full-length versus partial-length (V4) sequence diversity in the SILVA sequence database, we further estimate that there exist about 2.2-4.3 million full-length OTUs worldwide. When restricting our analysis to the Americas, while controlling for the number of studies, we obtain similar richness estimates as for the global data set, suggesting that most OTUs are globally distributed. Qualitatively similar results are also obtained for other 16S similarity thresholds (90{\%}, 95{\%}, and 99{\%}). Our estimates constrain the extent of a poorly quantified rare microbial biosphere and refute recent predictions that there exist trillions of prokaryotic OTUs.},

	Abstract = {Development of multicellularity was one of the major transitions in evolution and occurred independently multiple times in algae, plants, animals, and fungi. However recent comparative genome analyses suggest that fungi followed a different route to other eukaryotic lineages. To understand the driving forces behind the transition from unicellular fungi to hyphal forms of growth, we develop a comparative model of osmotrophic resource acquisition. This predicts that whenever the local resource is immobile, hard-to-digest, and nutrient poor, hyphal osmotrophs outcompete motile or autolytic unicellular osmotrophs. This hyphal advantage arises because transporting nutrients via a contiguous cytoplasm enables continued exploitation of remaining resources after local depletion of essential nutrients, and more efficient use of costly exoenzymes. The model provides a mechanistic explanation for the origins of multicellular hyphal organisms, and explains why fungi, rather than unicellular bacteria, evolved to dominate decay of recalcitrant, nutrient poor substrates such as leaf litter or wood.},

Significant progress has been made in recent years in describing the intestinal microbial composition based on the application of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-based approaches. These were not only instrumental in providing a phylogenetic framework of the more than 1000 different intestinal species but also illustrated the temporal and spatial diversity of the microbial GI tract composition that is host-specific and affected by the genotype. However, our knowledge of the molecular and cellular bases of host?microbe interactions in the GI tract is still very limited. Here an overview is presented of the most recent developments and applications of novel culture-independent approaches that promise to unravel the mechanisms of GI tract functionality and subsequent possibilities to exploit specifically these mechanisms in order to improve gut health.},

	Url = {http://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/12/1893.abstract N2 - Genetically identical cells exposed to the same environment display variability in gene expression (noise), with important consequences for the fidelity of cellular regulation and biological function. Although population average gene expression is tightly coupled to growth rate, the effects of changes in environmental conditions on expression variability are not known. Here, we measure the single-cell expression distributions of approximately 900 Saccharomyces cerevisiae promoters across four environmental conditions using flow cytometry, and find that gene expression noise is tightly coupled to the environment and is generally higher at lower growth rates. Nutrient-poor conditions, which support lower growth rates, display elevated levels of noise for most promoters, regardless of their specific expression values. We present a simple model of noise in expression that results from having an asynchronous population, with cells at different cell-cycle stages, and with different partitioning of the cells between the stages at different growth rates. This model predicts non-monotonic global changes in noise at different growth rates as well as overall higher variability in expression for cell-cycle–regulated genes in all conditions. The consistency between this model and our data, as well as with noise measurements of cells growing in a chemostat at well-defined growth rates, suggests that cell-cycle heterogeneity is a major contributor to gene expression noise. Finally, we identify gene and promoter features that play a role in gene expression noise across conditions. Our results show the existence of growth-related global changes in gene expression noise and suggest their potential phenotypic implications.},

By counting the protein copy number of each gene in the genome, we obtain the proteome---a comprehensive picture of a cell's biochemical machinery. The proteome reflects physiology, structure, metabolic capacities, and many other aspects of the cell's lifestyle. Here, we visualize quantitative proteome data using a graphical tool we call proteomaps, where proteins are shown as polygons whose sizes indicate the abundances. Proteins involved in similar cellular functions are arranged in adjacent locations, creating regions whose areas give insight into the relative investment in each functional class. Proteins or protein classes that dominate the proteomap indicate demanding cellular processes and promising targets for further research.Proteomics techniques generate an avalanche of data and promise to satisfy biologists' long-held desire to measure absolute protein abundances on a genome-wide scale. However, can this knowledge be translated into a clearer picture of how cells invest their protein resources? This article aims to give a broad perspective on the composition of proteomes as gleaned from recent quantitative proteomics studies. We describe proteomaps, an approach for visualizing the composition of proteomes with a focus on protein abundances and functions. In proteomaps, each protein is shown as a polygon-shaped tile, with an area representing protein abundance. Functionally related proteins appear in adjacent regions. General trends in proteomes, such as the dominance of metabolism and protein production, become easily visible. We make interactive visualizations of published proteome datasets accessible at www.proteomaps.net. We suggest that evaluating the way protein resources are allocated by various organisms and cell types in different conditions will sharpen our understanding of how and why cells regulate the composition of their proteomes.},

However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.},

@article{Jensen13,
	Abstract = {Over the last decade a shift in paradigm has occurred with respect to the interaction between environment and genes. It is now clear that animal genomes are regulated to a large extent as a result of input from environmental events and experiences, which cause short- and long-term modifications in epigenetic markings of DNA and histones. In this review, the evidence that such epigenetic modifications can affect the behaviour of animals is explored, and whether such acquired behaviour alterations can transfer across generation borders. First, the mechanisms by which experiences cause epigenetic modifications are examined. This includes, for example, methylation of cytosine in CpG positions and acetylation of histones, and studies showing that this can be modified by early experiences. Secondly, the evidence that specific modifications in the epigenome can be the cause of behaviour variation is reviewed. Thirdly, the extent to which this phenotypically active epigenetic variants can be inherited either through the germline or through reoccurring environmental conditions is examined. A particularly interesting observation is that epigenetic modifications are often linked to stress, and may possibly be mediated by steroid effects. Finally, the idea that transgenerationally stable epigenetic variants may serve as substrates for natural selection is explored, and it is speculated that they may even predispose for directed, non-random mutations.},

	Abstract = {Several different types of epigenetic inheritance system enable alternative functional states to be maintained in cell lineages that have identical DNA sequences. Both random and guided (directed) epigenetic variations can be transmitted by these systems, and lead to heritable modifications in cell structure and function. Although it is usually assumed that epigenetic inheritance does not occur between generations, both old and new experimental evidence suggest, and in some cases show explicitly, that epigenetic variations can be transmitted from parents to progeny. Simple models of epigenetic inheritance in asexual and sexual organisms are presented. These show that in populations of asexual unicellular organisms, the distinctive properties of induced epigenetic variations mean that the variations may be retained for many generations after the inducing stimulus is removed, even in the absence of selection. The models also show that the epigenetic systems enable some types of acquired character to be inherited in sexual, as well as asexual, organisms. The importance of epigenetic inheritance systems in the evolution of multicellularity is discussed.},

@article{Cornwallis17,
	Abstract = {Animals living in harsh environments, where temperatures are hot and rainfall is unpredictable, are more likely to breed in cooperative groups. As a result, harsh environmental conditions have been accepted as a key factor explaining the evolution of cooperation. However, this is based on evidence that has not investigated the order of evolutionary events, so the inferred causality could be incorrect. We resolved this problem using phylogenetic analyses of 4,707 bird species and found that causation was in the opposite direction to that previously assumed. Rather than harsh environments favouring cooperation, cooperative breeding has facilitated the colonization of harsh environments. Cooperative breeding was, in fact, more likely to evolve from ancestors occupying relatively cool environmental niches with predictable rainfall, which had low levels of polyandry and hence high within-group relatedness. We also found that polyandry increased after cooperative breeders invaded harsh environments, suggesting that when helpers have limited options to breed independently, polyandry no longer destabilizes cooperation. This provides an explanation for the puzzling cases of polyandrous cooperative breeding birds. More generally, this illustrates how cooperation can play a key role in invading ecological niches, a pattern observed across all levels of biological organization from cells to animal societies.},

@article{Black20,
	Abstract = {Evolutionary transitions in individuality are central to the emergence of biological complexity. Recent experiments provide glimpses of processes underpinning the transition from single cells to multicellular life and draw attention to the critical role of ecology. Here, we emphasize this ecological dimension and argue that its current absence from theoretical frameworks hampers development of general explanatory solutions. Using mechanistic mathematical models, we show how a minimal ecological structure comprising patchily distributed resources and between-patch dispersal can scaffold Darwinian-like properties on collectives of cells. This scaffolding causes cells to participate directly in the process of evolution by natural selection as if they were members of multicellular collectives, with collectives participating in a death--birth process arising from the interplay between the timing of dispersal events and the rate of resource use by cells. When this timescale is sufficiently long and new collectives are founded by single cells, collectives experience conditions that favour evolution of a reproductive division of labour. Together our simple model makes explicit key events in the major evolutionary transition to multicellularity. It also makes predictions concerning the life history of certain pathogens and serves as an ecological recipe for experimental realization of evolutionary transitions.},

@article{Heinrich87,
	Abstract = {A theoretical approach to the explanation of the structural design of metabolic pathways is presented. It is based on the hypothesis that due to natural selection during evolution the cellular metabolism of present-day organisms may be characterized by optimal properties. Two cardinal terms enter the theory: (i) the efficiency of a metabolic pathway and (ii) the evolutionary effort for the change of the kinetic parameters of enzymes by mutations of the corresponding genes. For both quantities simple mathematical expressions are proposed. While the efficiency is related to the reaction rates of the enzymes constituting the metabolic pathway, the evolutionary effort is considered to be a monotonically increasing function of the parameter values. By maximizing the efficiency under the constraint of a fixed evolutionary effort the theory allows the calculation of the optimal parameter distribution as the outcome of evolution processes. The methods developed are applied to the following systems: (a) linear reaction sequences with very low affinities of the enzymes towards substrates, (b) linear sequences consisting of saturable enzymatic reactions, (c) branched metabolic pathways consisting of segments of linear chains and (d) glycolysis of erythrocytes. The conclusion is derived that the optimal distribution of kinetic constants depends strongly on the equilibrium constants of the reactions as well as on the total osmolarity of the metabolic intermediates. Without osmotic constraints the evolutionary effort is mainly spent on the enzymes at the beginning of the chain. Using Michaelis-Menten equations the optimal state is characterized by a decrease of the maximal activities of the enzymes towards the end of the chain. These results are modified if osmotic constraints are taken into account. At the investigation of branched pathways the following results were obtained: firstly, if a certain end product may be synthesized along different pathways those which are thermodynamically more unfavourable (e.g. characterized by a small change of free energy) are eliminated in the course of evolution; secondly, if a branched pathway leads to several important end products those reaction segments which are thermodynamically unfavourable are characterized by a higher evolutionary effort. The application of the theory to a realistic model of glycolysis of erythrocytes leads to a correct desription of various functionally important properties of the system, such as the ratio between fluxes through different branches and theATP/ADPratio, whereas the theory cannot predict the strong separation of time constants observed in the real glycolytic system. It is concluded that the improvement of the predictive power of the theory necessitates the use of more complex functionals for the efficiency which take into account not only the fluxes but also other system properties such as the stability of the pathway or homoeostatic effects.},

Here, using experimental bacterial populations as proxies for nascent multicellular organisms, we manipulate ecological factors shaping the evolution of groups. Groups were propagated under regimes requiring reproduction via a life cycle replete with developmental and dispersal (propagule) phases, but in one treatment lineages never mixed, whereas in a second treatment, cells from different lineages experienced intense competition during the dispersal phase. The latter treatment favoured traits promoting cell growth at the expense of traits underlying group fitness ? a finding that is supported by results from a mathematical model. Our results show that the transition to multicellularity benefits from ecological conditions that maintain discreteness not just of the group (soma) phase, but also of the dispersal (germline) phase.},

	Url = {https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.60.10.3724-3731.1994 %X Flux balance models of metabolism use stoichiometry of metabolic pathways, metabolic demands of growth, and optimality principles to predict metabolic flux distribution and cellular growth under specified environmental conditions. These models have provided a mechanistic interpretation of systemic metabolic physiology, and they are also useful as a quantitative tool for metabolic pathway design. Quantitative predictions of cell growth and metabolic by-product secretion that are experimentally testable can be obtained from these models. In the present report, we used independent measurements to determine the model parameters for the wild-type Escherichia coli strain W3110. We experimentally determined the maximum oxygen utilization rate (15 mmol of O2 per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum aerobic glucose utilization rate (10.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the maximum anaerobic glucose utilization rate (18.5 mmol of Glc per g [dry weight] per h), the non-growth-associated maintenance requirements (7.6 mmol of ATP per g [dry weight] per h), and the growth-associated maintenance requirements (13 mmol of ATP per g of biomass). The flux balance model specified by these parameters was found to quantitatively predict glucose and oxygen uptake rates as well as acetate secretion rates observed in chemostat experiments. We have formulated a predictive algorithm in order to apply the flux balance model to describe unsteady-state growth and by-product secretion in aerobic batch, fed-batch, and anaerobic batch cultures. In aerobic experiments we observed acetate secretion, accumulation in the culture medium, and reutilization from the culture medium. In fed-batch cultures acetate is cometabolized with glucose during the later part of the culture period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Metacommunity models are now at the core of unified theories of biodiversity, but to date they have not addressed food web complexity. Here we show that metacommunity theory can explain the emergence of species-rich food webs with complex network topologies. Our analysis shows that network branching in the food web is maximized at intermediate colonization rates and limited dispersal scales, which also leads to concomitant peaks in species diversity. Increased food web complexity and species diversity are made possible by the structural role played by network branches that are supported by omnivore and generalist feeding links. Thus, in contrast to traditional food web theory, which emphasizes the destabilizing effect of omnivory feeding in closed systems, metacommunity theory predicts that these feeding links, which are commonly observed in empirical food webs, play a critical structural role as food webs assemble in space. As this mechanism functions at the metacommunity level, evidence for its operation in nature will be obtained through multiscale surveys of food web structure. Finally, we apply our theory to reveal the effects of habitat destruction on network complexity and metacommunity diversity.},

We explore the evolutionary consequences of niche construction using a two-locus population genetic model, which extends earlier analyses by allowing resource distributions to be influenced both by niche construction and by independent processes of renewal and depletion. The analysis confirms that niche construction can be a potent evolutionary agent by generating selection that leads to the fixation of otherwise deleterious alleles, supporting stable polymorphisms where none are expected, eliminating what would otherwise be stable polymorphisms, and generating unusual evolutionary dynamics. Even small amounts of niche construction, or niche construction that only weakly affects resource dynamics, can significantly alter both ecological and evolutionary patterns.},

@article{Danchin11,
	Abstract = {An emerging idea in evolutionary biology is that inheritance implies more than the sole transmission of the DNA sequence across generations. Non-genetic inheritance of information across generations results from various processes that contribute to parent--offspring resemblance, a property that is called heritability.The concept of heritability has been generalized into that of inclusive heritability, which is the heredity of differences, including all forms of inheritance. It unifies genetic and non-genetic heritability into a single framework encompassing the multiple dimensions of inheritance. We briefly provide evidence for the four identified processes of non-genetic inheritance.Epigenetic changes in DNA expression result in epigenetic inheritance when they are transmitted across generations, thus contributing to the transgenerational transmission of phenotypic variation. Epigenetic changes are usually mediated by changes in environmental conditions. Examples include the inheritance of maternal behaviour in rodents or the inheritance of flower symmetry.Parental non-genetic effects can result in the inheritance of non-genetic information across generations, thus contributing to the non-genetic component of inclusive heritability. Examples include the inheritance of immunocompetence against given parasites in birds or flexible adaptation to the maternal light environment in plants.Ecological inheritance occurs when offspring inherit the habitat of their parents. This indicates that any modification of the environment that results from ancestral activity and that affects fitness will change subsequent selective pressures. Examples include the webs, nests, dams and burrows that numerous animal species create, but also the changes in atmospheric gases and soil nutrients brought about by bacteria and plant species.Culture is the part of phenotypic variance that is transmitted through social learning. Recent evidence suggests that cultural transmission is widespread among animals. Examples concern mate choice and species recognition. Cultural selection constitutes another engine of evolution when it interacts with natural selection in both animals and humans.Non-genetic inheritance can easily be confounded with genetic inheritance. It is the intricate network of genetic and non-genetic inheritance systems that produce parent--offspring resemblance, which constitutes the whole evolutionary potential of a trait quantified by inclusive heritability.We formally partition inclusive heritability and propose methods to disentangle its components in order to better integrate them into a comprehensive view of inheritance. We propose specific designs coupling field or experimental longitudinal data with animal model types of statistical tools.Such methods should help to unravel fascinating enigmas in evolution and medicine, such as major evolutionary transitions or the 'missing heritability' in the human genome.The time is ripe to broaden concepts of inheritance and heritability in order to fully grasp the richness of evolutionary processes, and we call for a multidimensional modern synthesis that would merge the current modern synthesis with an inclusive view of inheritance.},

The production of molecules by B. subtilis cells, as well as their response to these signals, is not uniform across the population. There is specificity and heterogeneity both within genetically identical populations as well as at the strain-level and species-level. This review will discuss how extracellular signaling compounds influence B. subtilis multicellularity with regard to matrix-producing cannibal differentiation, germination, and swarming behavior, as well as the specificity of the quorum-sensing peptides ComX and CSF. It will also highlight how imaging mass spectrometry can aid in identifying signaling compounds and contribute to our understanding of the functional relationship between such compounds and multicellular behavior.},

	Abstract = {Surface-attached bacterial biofilms are self-replicating active liquid crystals and the dominant form of bacterial life on Earth1--4. In conventional liquid crystals and solid-state materials, the interaction potentials between the molecules that comprise the system determine the material properties. However, for growth-active biofilms it is unclear whether potential-based descriptions can account for the experimentally observed morphologies, and which potentials would be relevant. Here, we have overcome previous limitations of single-cell imaging techniques5,6 to reconstruct and track all individual cells inside growing three-dimensional biofilms with up to 10,000 individuals. Based on these data, we identify, constrain and provide a microscopic basis for an effective cell--cell interaction potential, which captures and predicts the growth dynamics, emergent architecture and local liquid-crystalline order of Vibrio cholerae biofilms. Furthermore, we show how external fluid flows control the microscopic structure and three-dimensional morphology of biofilms. Our analysis implies that local cellular order and global biofilm architecture in these active bacterial communities can arise from mechanical cell--cell interactions, which cells can modulate by regulating the production of particular matrix components. These results establish an experimentally validated foundation for improved continuum theories of active matter and thereby contribute to solving the important problem of controlling biofilm growth.},

During both modes of surface translocation, fluid uptake and transport play a key role in shaping the overall morphology and spreading dynamics. Here we develop a generalized two-phase thin-film model that couples bacterial growth, extracellular matrix swelling, fluid flow, and nutrient transport to describe the expansion of both highly motile bacterial swarms, and sessile bacterial biofilms. We show that swarm expansion corresponds to steady-state solutions in a nutrient-rich, capillarity dominated regime. In contrast, biofilm colony growth is described by transient solutions associated with a nutrient-limited, extracellular polymer stress driven limit. We apply our unified framework to explain a range of recent experimental observations of steady and unsteady expansion of microbial swarms and biofilms. Our results demonstrate how the physics of flow and transport in slender geometries serve to constrain biological organization in microbial communities.},

	Abstract = {Some multicellular organisms can fuse because mergers potentially provide mutual benefits. However, experimental evolution in the fungus Neurospora crassa has demonstrated that free fusion of mycelia favours cheater lineages, but the mechanism and evolutionary dynamics of this exploitation are unknown. Here we show, paradoxically, that all convergently evolved cheater lineages have similar fusion deficiencies. These mutants are unable to initiate fusion but retain access to wild-type mycelia that fuse with them. This asymmetry reduces cheater-mutant contributions to somatic substrate-bound hyphal networks, but increases representation of their nuclei in the aerial reproductive hyphae. Cheaters only benefit when relatively rare and likely impose genetic load reminiscent of germline senescence. We show that the consequences of somatic fusion can be unequally distributed among fusion partners, with the passive non-fusing partner profiting more. We discuss how our findings may relate to the extensive variation in fusion frequency of fungi found in nature.},

	N2 = {Biofilms, in which cells attach to surfaces and secrete slime (polymeric substances), are central to microbial life. Biofilms are often thought to require high levels of cooperation because extracellular polymeric substances are a shared resource produced by one cell that can be used by others. Here we examine this hypothesis by using a detailed individual-based simulation of a biofilm to investigate the outcome of evolutionary competitions between strains that differ in their level of polymer production. Our model includes a biochemical description of the carbon fluxes for growth and polymer production, and it explicitly calculates diffusion--reaction effects and the resulting solute gradients in the biofilm. An emergent property of these simple but realistic mechanistic assumptions is a strong evolutionary advantage to extracellular polymer production. Polymer secretion is altruistic to cells above a focal cell: it pushes later generations in their lineage up and out into better oxygen conditions, but it harms others; polymer production suffocates neighboring nonpolymer producers. This property, analogous to vertical growth in plants, suggests that polymer secretion provides a strong competitive advantage to cell lineages within mixed-genotype biofilms: global cooperation is not required. Our model fundamentally changes how biofilms are expected to respond to changing social conditions; the presence of multiple strains in a biofilm should promote rather than inhibit polymer secretion.EPS,extracellular polymeric substances;EPS+,EPS-producing strain;EPS−,non-EPS-producing strain.},

The most advanced societies, such as those displayed by social insects, consist of reproductive and nonreproductive castes. The caste system fundamentally affects the way natural selection operates. Specifically, selection acts directly on reproductive castes, such as queens, but only indirectly through the process of kin selection on nonreproductive castes, such as workers. In this study, we present theoretical analyses to determine the rate of substitution at loci expressed exclusively in the queen or worker castes. We show that the rate of substitution is the same for queen- and worker-selected loci when the queen is singly mated. In contrast, when a queen is multiply mated, queen-selected loci show higher rates of substitution for adaptive alleles and lower rates of substitution for deleterious alleles than worker-selected loci. We compare our theoretical expectations to previously obtained genomic data from the honeybee, Apis mellifera, where queens mate multiply and the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, where queens mate singly and find that rates of evolution of queen- and worker-selected loci are consistent with our predictions. Overall, our research tests theoretical expectations using empirically obtained genomic data to better understand the evolution of advanced societies.},

Development from a single-celled zygote resets relatedness among cells to its maximum value each generation, which should accomplish segregation of cheating mutants from non-cheaters and thereby protect multicellular cooperation. Here we provide the crucial direct comparison between high- and low-relatedness conditions to test this hypothesis. We allow two variants of the fungus Neurospora crassa to evolve, one with and one without the ability to form chimeras with other individuals, thus generating two relatedness levels. While multicellular cooperation remains high in the high-relatedness lines, it significantly decreases in all replicate low-relatedness lines, resulting in an average threefold decrease in spore yield. This reduction is caused by cheating mutants with reduced investment in somatic functions, but increased competitive success when fusing with non-cheaters. Our experiments demonstrate that high genetic relatedness is crucial to sustain multicellular cooperation.},

The advantages of living in cooperative groups are well understood, but why some species breed in small aggregations while others evolve large, complex groups with clearly divided roles is unclear. We address this problem by reconstructing the evolutionary pathways to cooperative breeding across 4,730 bird species. We show that differences in the way groups form at the origin of cooperative breeding predicts the level of group complexity that emerges. Groups that originate through the retention of offspring have a clear reproductive divide with distinct breeder and helper roles. This is associated with reproductive specialization, where breeders invest more in fecundity and less in care. In contrast, groups formed through the aggregation of unrelated adults are smaller and lack specialization. These results help explain why some species have not transitioned beyond simple groups while others have taken the pathway to increased group complexity.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of competitive interactions among viruses1 was studied in the RNA phage φ6 at high and low multiplicities of infection (that is, at high and low ratios of infecting phage to host cells). At high multiplicities, many phage infect and reproduce in the same host cell, whereas at low multiplicities the viruses reproduce mainly as clones. An unexpected result of this study1 was that phage grown at high rates of co-infection increased in fitness initially, but then evolved lowered fitness. Here we show that the fitness of the high-multiplicity phage relative to their ancestors generates a pay-off matrix conforming to the prisoner's dilemma strategy of game theory2,3. In this strategy, defection (selfishness) evolves, despite the greater fitness pay-off that would result if all players were to cooperate. Viral cooperation and defection can be defined as, respectively, the manufacturing and sequestering of diffusible (shared) intracellular products. Because the low-multiplicity phage did not evolve lowered fitness, we attribute the evolution of selfishness to the lack of clonal structure and the mixing of unrelated genotypes at high multiplicity4,5,6.},

	Abstract = {Reproductive division of labor (e.g. germ-soma specialization) is a hallmark of the evolution of multicellularity, signifying the emergence of a new type of individual and facilitating the evolution of increased organismal complexity. A large body of work from evolutionary biology, economics, and ecology has shown that specialization is beneficial when further division of labor produces an accelerating increase in absolute productivity (i.e. productivity is a convex function of specialization). Here we show that reproductive specialization is qualitatively different from classical models of resource sharing, and can evolve even when the benefits of specialization are saturating (i.e. productivity is a concave function of specialization). Through analytical theory and evolutionary individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that reproductive specialization is strongly favored in sparse networks of cellular interactions that reflect the morphology of early, simple multicellular organisms, highlighting the importance of restricted social interactions in the evolution of reproductive specialization.},

@article{Marquez-Zacarias21,
	Abstract = {Multicellularity has evolved numerous times across the tree of life. One of the most fundamental distinctions among multicellular organisms is their developmental mode: whether they stay together during growth and develop clonally, or form a group through the aggregation of free-living cells. The five eukaryotic lineages to independently evolve complex multicellularity (animals, plants, red algae, brown algae, and fungi) all develop clonally. This fact has largely been explained through social evolutionary theory's lens of cooperation and conflict, where cheating within non-clonal groups has the potential to undermine multicellular adaptation. Multicellular organisms that form groups via aggregation could mitigate the costs of cheating by evolving kin recognition systems that prevent the formation of chimeric groups. However, recent work suggests that selection for the ability to aggregate quickly may constrain the evolution of highly specific kin recognition, sowing the seeds for persistent evolutionary conflict. Importantly, other features of aggregative multicellular life cycles may independently act to constrain the evolution of complex multicellularity. All known aggregative multicellular organisms are facultatively multicellular (as opposed to obligately multicellular), allowing unicellular-level adaptation to environmental selection. Because they primarily exist in a unicellular state, it may be difficult for aggregative multicellular organisms to evolve multicellular traits that carry pleiotropic cell-level fitness costs. Thus, even in the absence of social conflict, aggregative multicellular organisms may have limited potential for the evolution of complex multicellularity.},

	Abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) proteins constitute a conserved gene silencing system with widespread roles in multicellular development, stem cell biology and cancer.Gene silencing is carried out by Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2, which each consist of families of related complexes.An enzyme function associated with the PRC1 family is histone H2A ubiquitylation on K119, and a function of the PRC2 family is histone H3 methylation on K27. Specific PRC1 and PRC2 variants are also implicated in polynucleosome compaction.Targeting of PcG complexes is mediated by trans-acting recruiters and cis-acting Polycomb response elements. In Drosophila melanogaster, several DNA-binding proteins, including the zinc finger protein Pleiohomeotic, serve as recruiters. PcG targeting is not well understood in mammals, in which recruiters and response elements are less well defined.Recent evidence implicates long non-coding RNAs in PcG recruitment to mammalian Hox loci, the inactive X-chromosome and paternally imprinted genes.Trimethylated H3K27 contributes to PRC1 interaction with local nucleosomes, but there are probably other molecular determinants of PRC1 association with chromatin.Multiple versions of PRC1 family complexes, with related but non-identical subunit compositions, exist in both D. melanogaster and mammalian cells. Histone H2A ubiquitylation might be mediated by a subset of these PRC1 family complexes, and additional family members might supply other chromatin-modifying functions.Transcriptional elongation is emerging as an attractive candidate for a step that is affected in PcG silencing. Both histone H2A ubiquitylation and polynucleosome compaction could contribute to barriers that impede RNA polymerase II movement. This possibility correlates with recent genome-wide studies that reveal paused RNA polymerase on ∼30{\%} of mammalian genes.},

	N2 = {Author Summary Understanding the transition to multicellularity remains a key unanswered question in evolutionary biology. The transition required three essential cellular features to evolve: adhesion, signaling and differentiation. In particular, cell differentiation requires sensitivity to environmental cues to create distinct cell-specific transcription profiles. Previous work with model organisms and gene network models showed that biological systems evolve robustness to both mutational and environmental perturbations under stabilizing selection and that furthermore, mutational and environmental robustness are correlated. Increased robustness to environmental cues will therefore pose a barrier to the development of cell differentiation, and thus multicellularity. Because several important epigenetic developmental mechanisms, particularly Polycomb-mediated histone modification, appear to have evolved with multicellularity, we hypothesized that such a mechanism facilitated sensitivity to the environment and therefore cell differentiation. Using a computational model, we integrated Polycomb function with a regulatory model, revealing a clear decoupling between environmental and mutational robustness, allowing increased environmental sensitivity while mutational robustness remained intact. We also found that Polycomb greatly facilitated the ability for a single gene network to create several distinct transcription profiles - each representing a distinct differentiated cell type. Our work highlights the simple elegance through which the evolution of a key epigenetic mechanism can facilitate the transition to functional cell differentiation.},

	Abstract = {Cooperation is central to the emergence of multicellular life; however, the means by which the earliest collectives (groups of cells) maintained integrity in the face of destructive cheating types is unclear. One idea posits cheats as a primitive germ line in a life cycle that facilitates collective reproduction. Here we describe an experiment in which simple cooperating lineages of bacteria were propagated under a selective regime that rewarded collective-level persistence. Collectives reproduced via life cycles that either embraced, or purged, cheating types. When embraced, the life cycle alternated between phenotypic states. Selection fostered inception of a developmental switch that underpinned the emergence of collectives whose fitness, during the course of evolution, became decoupled from the fitness of constituent cells. Such development and decoupling did not occur when groups reproduced via a cheat-purging regime. Our findings capture key events in the evolution of Darwinian individuality during the transition from single cells to multicellularity.},

	Abstract = {The transition from unicellular to multicellular life was one of a few major events in the history of life that created new opportunities for more complex biological systems to evolve. Predation is hypothesized as one selective pressure that may have driven the evolution of multicellularity. Here we show that de novo origins of simple multicellularity can evolve in response to predation. We subjected outcrossed populations of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to selection by the filter-feeding predator Paramecium tetraurelia. Two of five experimental populations evolved multicellular structures not observed in unselected control populations within ~750 asexual generations. Considerable variation exists in the evolved multicellular life cycles, with both cell number and propagule size varying among isolates. Survival assays show that evolved multicellular traits provide effective protection against predation. These results support the hypothesis that selection imposed by predators may have played a role in some origins of multicellularity.},

@article{Bich19,
	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework to understand how multicellular systems realize functionally integrated physiological entities by organizing their intercellular space. From a perspective centered on physiology and integration, biological systems are often characterized as organized in such a way that they realize metabolic self-production and self-maintenance. The existence and activity of their components rely on the network they realize and on the continuous management of the exchange of matter and energy with their environment. One of the virtues of the organismic approach focused on organization is that it can provide an understanding of how biological systems are functionally integrated into coherent wholes. Organismic frameworks have been primarily developed by focusing on unicellular life. Multicellularity, however, presents additional challenges to our understanding of biological systems, related to how cells are capable to live together in higher-order entities, in such a way that some of their features and behaviors are constrained and controlled by the system they realize. Whereas most accounts of multicellularity focus on cell differentiation and increase in size as the main elements to understand biological systems at this level of organization, we argue that these factors are insufficient to provide an understanding of how cells are physically and functionally integrated in a coherent system. In this paper, we provide a new theoretical framework to understand multicellularity, capable to overcome these issues. Our thesis is that one of the fundamental theoretical principles to understand multicellularity, which is missing or underdeveloped in current accounts, is the functional organization of the intercellular space. In our view, the capability to be organized in space plays a central role in this context, as it enables (and allows to exploit all the implications of) cell differentiation and increase in size, and even specialized functions such as immunity. We argue that the extracellular matrix plays a crucial active role in this respect, as an evolutionary ancient and specific (non-cellular) control subsystem that contributes as a key actor to the functional specification of the multicellular space and to modulate cell fate and behavior. We also analyze how multicellular systems exert control upon internal movement and communication. Finally, we show how the organization of space is involved in some of the failures of multicellular organization, such as aging and cancer.},

To understand this difference in the genetics of phenotypic evolution, we compared the expression and function of genes in the underlying regulatory networks. We found that the pathway of evolution is influenced by differences in gene regulatory network architecture in different developmental contexts, as well as by whether a trait is lost or gained. Therefore, hotspots in one context may not readily evolve in a different context. This has important implications for understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic change and the predictability of evolution.},

	Abstract = {Gene expression is controlled primarily by transcription factors, whose DNA binding sites are typically 10 nt long. We develop a population-genetic model to understand how the length and information content of such binding sites evolve. Our analysis is based on an inherent trade-off between specificity, which is greater in long binding sites, and robustness to mutation, which is greater in short binding sites. The evolutionary stable distribution of binding site lengths predicted by the model agrees with the empirical distribution (5-31 nt, with mean 9.9 nt for eukaryotes), and it is remarkably robust to variation in the underlying parameters of population size, mutation rate, number of transcription factor targets, and strength of selection for proper binding and selection against improper binding. In a systematic data set of eukaryotic and prokaryotic transcription factors we also uncover strong relationships between the length of a binding site and its information content per nucleotide, as well as between the number of targets a transcription factor regulates and the information content in its binding sites. Our analysis explains these features as well as the remarkable conservation of binding site characteristics across diverse taxa.},

	Abstract = {Genetic studies during the past decades have revealed tightly regulated transcriptional networks that control robust developmental programs. However, this deterministic view of development contrasts with recent genomic studies that suggest that the multiple steps of transcription are by themselves rather leaky.Although any single transcription factor (TF) can typically bind to thousands of sites throughout the genome, cis-regulatory activity at enhancers requires the concerted action of multiple binding events (which can be homotypic or heterotypic).TFs bind to enhancers in a combinatorial manner, which is facilitated through direct and indirect cooperative mechanisms. The combinatorial nature of enhancer occupancy allows genes to be regulated in complex patterns in both space and time.DNA and proteins can act together as a scaffold to cooperatively recruit TFs to enhancers.Enhancers undergo progressive changes during development, in which their occupancy by TFs, and the position of nucleosomes with or without post-translational modifications, reflect their inactive, poised or active state.Pioneer TFs recruit chromatin-remodelling factors to reposition nucleosomes, thus facilitating the occupancy of other TFs at subsequent developmental stages.Enhancer priming can occur through many different mechanisms. For example, some TF binding events may serve as placeholders to prevent nucleosome repositioning.Partially redundant enhancers can act to buffer changes in environmental conditions to ensure robust developmental progression.Multiple elements regulating the same gene seem to assemble in a three-dimensional structure with the promoter, and can have synergistic or repressive influences on each other.},

	N2 = {Abstract Quantitative genetic models of evolution of phenotypic plasticity are used to derive environmental tolerance curves for a population in a changing environment, providing a theoretical foundation for integrating physiological and community ecology with evolutionary genetics of plasticity and norms of reaction. Plasticity is modelled for a labile quantitative character undergoing continuous reversible development and selection in a fluctuating environment. If there is no cost of plasticity, a labile character evolves expected plasticity equalling the slope of the optimal phenotype as a function of the environment. This contrasts with previous theory for plasticity influenced by the environment at a critical stage of early development determining a constant adult phenotype on which selection acts, for which the expected plasticity is reduced by the environmental predictability over the discrete time lag between development and selection. With a cost of plasticity in a labile character, the expected plasticity depends on the cost and on the environmental variance and predictability averaged over the continuous developmental time lag. Environmental tolerance curves derived from this model confirm traditional assumptions in physiological ecology and provide new insights. Tolerance curve width increases with larger environmental variance, but can only evolve within a limited range. The strength of the trade-off between tolerance curve height and width depends on the cost of plasticity. Asymmetric tolerance curves caused by male sterility at high temperature are illustrated. A simple condition is given for a large transient increase in plasticity and tolerance curve width following a sudden change in average environment.},

When organisms need to perform multiple tasks, a trade-off arises because no phenotype can optimize all tasks. Recent work addressed this question, and assumed that the performance at each task decays with distance in trait space from the best phenotype at that task. Under this assumption, the best-fitness solutions (termed the Pareto front) lie on simple low-dimensional shapes in trait space: line segments, triangles and other polygons. The vertices of these polygons are specialists at a single task. Here, we generalize this finding, by considering performance functions of general form, not necessarily functions that decay monotonically with distance from their peak. We find that, except for performance functions with highly eccentric contours, simple shapes in phenotype space are still found, but with mildly curving edges instead of straight ones. In a wide range of systems, complex data on multiple quantitative traits, which might be expected to fill a high-dimensional phenotype space, is predicted instead to collapse onto low-dimensional shapes; phenotypes near the vertices of these shapes are predicted to be specialists, and can thus suggest which tasks may be at play.},

@article{Benger13,
	Abstract = {The most common models of sequence evolution used to make inferences about adaptation rely on the assumption that selective pressures at a site remain constant through time. Instead, one might plausibly imagine that a change in the environment renders an allele beneficial and that when it fixes, the site is now constrained---until another change in the environment occurs that affects the selective pressures at that site. With this view in mind, we introduce a simple dynamic model for the evolution of coding regions, in which non-synonymous sites alternate between being fixed for the favored allele and being neutral with respect to other alleles. We use the pruning algorithm to derive closed forms for observable patterns of polymorphism and divergence in terms of the model parameters. Using our model, estimates of the fraction of beneficial substitutions αwould remain similar to those obtained from existing approaches. In this framework, however, it becomes natural to ask how often adaptive substitutions originate from previously constrained or previously neutral sites, i.e., about the source of adaptive substitutions. We show that counts of coding sites that are both polymorphic in a sample from one species and divergent between two others carry information about this parameter. We also extend the basic model to include the effects of weakly deleterious mutations and discuss the importance of assumptions about the distribution of deleterious mutations among constrained non-synonymous sites. Finally, we derive a likelihood function for the parameters and apply it to a toy example, variation data for coding regions from chromosome 2 of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. This modeling work underscores how restrictive assumptions about adaptation have been to date, and how further work in this area will help to reveal unexplored and yet basic characteristics of adaptation.},

On the basis of 13C-determined fluxes from nine bacteria and multi-objective optimization theory, we show that metabolism operates close to the Pareto-optimal surface of a three-dimensional space defined by competing objectives. Consistent with flux data from evolved Escherichia coli, we propose that flux states evolve under the trade-off between two principles: optimality under one given condition and minimal adjustment between conditions. These principles form the forces by which evolution shapes metabolic fluxes in microorganisms'environmental context.},

The origin of such continuum gene-expression patterns is unclear. To address this, we develop a theory to understand how a continuum provides division of labor in a tissue in which cells collectively contribute to several tasks. We find that a continuum is optimal when there are spatial gradients in the tissue that affect the performance in each task. The continuum is bounded inside a polyhedron whose vertices are expression profiles optimal at each task. We test this using single-cell gene expression for intestinal villi and liver hepatocytes, which form a curved 1D trajectory and a full 3D tetrahedron in gene-expression space, respectively. We infer the tasks for both cell types and characterize the spatial zonation of the task-specialist cells. This approach can be generally applied to other tissues.},

We find that trade-offs between tasks constrain tumor gene-expression to a continuum bounded by a polyhedron whose vertices are gene-expression profiles, each specializing in one task. We find five universal cancer tasks across tissue-types: cell-division, biomass and energy, lipogenesis, immune-interaction and invasion and tissue-remodeling. Tumors that specialize in a task are sensitive to drugs that interfere with this task. Driver, but not passenger, mutations tune gene-expression towards specialization in specific tasks.

Understanding this diversity and its biological meaning requires a theoretical framework, which could in turn guide the development of more accurate prognosis and therapy. Here, we review the theory of multi-task evolution of cancer, which is based upon the premise that tumours evolve in the host and face selection trade-offs between multiple biological functions. This theory can help identify the major biological tasks that cancer cells perform and the trade-offs between these tasks. It introduces the concept of specialist tumours, which focus on one task, and generalist tumours, which perform several tasks. Specialist tumours are suggested to be sensitive to therapy targeting their main task. Driver mutations tune gene expression towards specific tasks in a tissue-dependent manner and thus help to determine whether a tumour is specialist or generalist. We discuss potential applications of the theory of multi-task evolution to interpret the spatial organization of tumours and intratumour heterogeneity.},

	N2 = {Abstract Adaptation to a sudden extreme change in environment, beyond the usual range of background environmental fluctuations, is analysed using a quantitative genetic model of phenotypic plasticity. Generations are discrete, with time lag τbetween a critical period for environmental influence on individual development and natural selection on adult phenotypes. The optimum phenotype, and genotypic norms of reaction, are linear functions of the environment. Reaction norm elevation and slope (plasticity) vary among genotypes. Initially, in the average background environment, the character is canalized with minimum genetic and phenotypic variance, and no correlation between reaction norm elevation and slope. The optimal plasticity is proportional to the predictability of environmental fluctuations over time lag τ. During the first generation in the new environment the mean fitness suddenly drops and the mean phenotype jumps towards the new optimum phenotype by plasticity. Subsequent adaptation occurs in two phases. Rapid evolution of increased plasticity allows the mean phenotype to closely approach the new optimum. The new phenotype then undergoes slow genetic assimilation, with reduction in plasticity compensated by genetic evolution of reaction norm elevation in the original environment.},

	Abstract = {Summary I elaborate an hypothesis to explain inconsistent empirical findings comparing phenotypic plasticity in colonizing populations or species with plasticity from their native or ancestral range. Quantitative genetic theory on the evolution of plasticity reveals that colonization of a novel environment can cause a transient increase in plasticity: a rapid initial increase in plasticity accelerates evolution of a new optimal phenotype, followed by slow genetic assimilation of the new phenotype and reduction of plasticity. An association of colonization with increased plasticity depends on the difference in the optimal phenotype between ancestral and colonized environments, the difference in mean, variance and predictability of the environment, the cost of plasticity, and the time elapsed since colonization. The relative importance of these parameters depends on whether a phenotypic character develops by one-shot plasticity to a constant adult phenotype or by labile plasticity involving continuous and reversible development throughout adult life.},

	Abstract = {Recently interest in multi-generational epigenetic phenomena have been fuelled by highly reproducible intergenerational and transgenerational inheritance paradigms in several model organisms. Such paradigms are essential in order to begin to use genetics to unpick the mechanistic bases of how epigenetic information may be transmitted between generations; indeed great strides have been made towards understanding these mechanisms. Far less well understood is the relationship between epigenetic inheritance, ecology and evolution. In this review I focus on potential connections between laboratory studies of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance phenomena and evolutionary processes that occur in natural populations. In the first section, I consider whether transgenerational epigenetic inheritance might provide an advantage to organisms over the short term in adapting to their environment. Second, I consider whether epigenetic changes can contribute to the evolution of species by contributing to stable phenotypic variation within a population. Finally I discuss whether epigenetic changes could influence evolution by either directly or indirectly promoting DNA sequence changes that could impact phenotypic divergence. Additionally, I will discuss how epigenetic changes could influence the evolution of human cancer and thus be directly relevant for the development of this disease.},

A formal model of such a dual inheritance system is presented, and it is shown how the separation between the two systems can sometimes break down.

@article{Price03,
	Abstract = {Models of population divergence and speciation are often based on the assumption that differences between populations are due to genetic factors, and that phenotypic change is due to natural selection. It is equally plausible that some of the differences among populations are due to phenotypic plasticity. We use the metaphor of the adaptive landscape to review the role of phenotypic plasticity in driving genetic evolution. Moderate levels of phenotypic plasticity are optimal in permitting population survival in a new environment and in bringing populations into the realm of attraction of an adaptive peak. High levels of plasticity may increase the probability of population persistence but reduce the likelihood of genetic change, because the plastic response itself places the population close to a peak. Moderate levels of plasticity arise whenever multiple traits, some of which are plastic and others not, form a composite trait involved in the adaptive response. For example, altered behaviours may drive selection on morphology and physiology. Because there is likely to be a considerable element of chance in which behaviours become established, behavioural change followed by morphological and physiological evolution may be a potent force in driving evolution in novel directions. We assess the role of phenotypic plasticity in stimulating evolution by considering two examples from birds: (i) the evolution of red and yellow plumage coloration due to carotenoid consumption; and (ii) the evolution of foraging behaviours on islands. Phenotypic plasticity is widespread in nature and may speed up, slow down, or have little effect on evolutionary change. Moderate levels of plasticity may often facilitate genetic evolution but careful analyses of individual cases are needed to ascertain whether plasticity has been essential or merely incidental to population differentiation.},

These in turn affect the way species divide the environments among themselves in communities, and, therefore, the numbers of species which can coexist.

	Abstract = {Understanding mechanisms of evolutionary diversification is central to evolutionary biology. Microbes constitute promising model systems for observing processes of diversification directly in the laboratory. One of the main existing paradigms for microbial diversification is the evolution of cross-feeding polymorphisms, in which a strain specializing on a primary resource coexists with a cross-feeding strain that specializes on a waste product resulting from consumption of the primary resource. Here I propose a theoretical model for the evolutionary dynamics through which cross-feeding polymorphisms can gradually emerge from a single ancestral strain. The model is based on the framework of adaptive dynamics, which has proved to be very useful for studying adaptive processes of divergence under sympatric conditions. In particular, the phenomenon of evolutionary branching serves as a general paradigm for diversification. I show that evolutionary branching naturally occurs in evolutionary models of cross-feeding if (1) there is a trade-off between uptake efficiencies on the primary and secondary resources, and (2) this trade-off has positive curvature. The model also suggests that the evolution of cross-feeding should be more likely in chemostat cultures than in serial batch cultures, which conforms with empirical observations. Overall, the model provides a theoretical metaphor for the evolution of cross-feeding polymorphisms.},

Experimental evolution at low relatedness favored cheating mutants that could destroy multicellular development. However, under high relatedness, the forces of mutation and within-individual selection are too small for these destructive cheaters to spread, as shown by a mutation accumulation experiment.

	Abstract = {The structural design of ATP and NADH producing systems, such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle (TCA), is analysed using optimization principles. It is assumed that these pathways combined with oxidative phosphorylation have reached, during their evolution, a high efficiency with respect to ATP production rates. On the basis of kinetic and thermodynamic principles, conclusions are derived concerning the optimal stoichiometry of such pathways. Extending previous investigations, both the concentrations of adenine nucleotides as well as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides are considered variable quantities. This implies the consideration of the interaction of an ATP and NADH producing system, an ATP consuming system, a system coupling NADH consumption with ATP production and a system consuming NADH decoupled from ATP production. It is examined in what respect real metabolic pathways can be considered optimal by studying a large number of alternative pathways. The kinetics of the individual reactions are described by linear or bilinear functions of reactant concentrations. In this manner, the steady-state ATP production rate can be calculated for any possible ATP and NADH producing pathway. It is shown that most of the possible pathways result in a very low ATP production rate and that the very efficient pathways share common structural properties. Optimization with respect to the ATP production rate is performed by an evolutionary algorithm. The following results of our analysis are in close correspondence to the real design of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. (1) In all efficient pathways the ATP consuming reactions are located near the beginning. (2) In all efficient pathways NADH producing reactions as well as ATP producing reactions are located near the end. (3) The number of NADH molecules produced by the consumption of one energy-rich molecule (glucose) amounts to four in all efficient pathways. A distance measure and a measure for the internal ordering of reactions are introduced to study differences and similarities in the stoichiometries of metabolic pathways.},

	Abstract = {A theoretical approach to the explanation of the structural design of metabolic pathways is presented. It is based on the hypothesis that due to natural selection during evolution the cellular metabolism of present-day organisms may be characterized by optimal properties. Two cardinal terms enter the theory: 1) the efficiency of metabolic pathways and 2) the evolutionary effort for the change of the kinetic parameters of the involved enzymes by mutations of the corresponding genes. For both quantities simple mathematical expressions are proposed. By maximizing the efficiency under the constraint of a constant evolutionary effort the theory allows the calculation of the optimal parameter distribution. The theoretical concept is applied to simple metabolic systems consisting of monomolecular reactions only. It is shown that in the optimal state of the linear enzymatic chain the evolutionary effort is mainly spent on the enzymes located at the beginning of the chain. This tendency is more pronounced if the kinetic equations of the enzymes are first-order rate laws. With respect to Michaelis-Menten enzymes the optimal state is characterized by a decrease of the maximal activities and an increase of the fractional saturation of the enzymes towards the end of the chain.},

Intercellular communication and multicellular coordination are now known to be widespread among prokaryotes and to affect multiple phenotypes. Many different classes of signaling molecules have been identified in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. Bacteria have sophisticated signal transduction networks for integrating intercellular signals with other information to make decisions about gene expression and cellular differentiation. Coordinated multicellular behavior can be observed in a variety of situations, including development of E. coli and B. subtilis colonies, swarming by Proteus and Serratia, and spatially organized interspecific metabolic cooperation in anaerobic bioreactor granules. Bacteria benefit from multicellular cooperation by using cellular division of labor, accessing resources that cannot effectively be utilized by single cells, collectively defending against antagonists, and optimizing population survival by differentiating into distinct cell types.},

When analyzed within the context of highly structured, surface-associated communities (biofilms), spore formation was discovered to have heretofore unsuspected spatial organization. Initially, motile cells differentiated into aligned chains of attached cells that eventually produced aerial structures, or fruiting bodies, that served as preferential sites for sporulation. Fruiting body formation depended on regulatory genes required early in sporulation and on genes evidently needed for exopolysaccharide and surfactin production. The formation of aerial structures was robust in natural isolates but not in laboratory strains, an indication that multicellularity has been lost during domestication of B. subtilis. Other microbial differentiation processes long thought to involve only single cells could display the spatial organization characteristic of multicellular organisms when studied with recent natural isolates.},

	Abstract = {The origin of life has puzzled molecular scientists for over half a century. Yet fundamental questions remain unanswered, including which came first, the metabolic machinery or the encoding nucleic acids. In this study we take a protein-centric view and explore the ancestral origins of proteins. Protein domain structures in proteomes are highly conserved and embody molecular functions and interactions that are needed for cellular and organismal processes. Here we use domain structure to study the evolution of molecular function in the protein world. Timelines describing the age and function of protein domains at fold, fold superfamily, and fold family levels of structural complexity were derived from a structural phylogenomic census in hundreds of fully sequenced genomes. These timelines unfold congruent hourglass patterns in rates of appearance of domain structures and functions, functional diversity, and hierarchical complexity, and revealed a gradual build up of protein repertoires associated with metabolism, translation and DNA, in that order. The most ancient domain architectures were hydrolase enzymes and the first translation domains had catalytic functions for the aminoacylation and the molecular switch-driven transport of RNA. Remarkably, the most ancient domains had metabolic roles, did not interact with RNA, and preceded the gradual build-up of translation. In fact, the first translation domains had also a metabolic origin and were only later followed by specialized translation machinery. Our results explain how the generation of structure in the protein world and the concurrent crystallization of translation and diversified cellular life created further opportunities for proteomic diversification.},

	Abstract = {Communication is an undisputed central activity of life that requires an evolving molecular language. It conveys meaning through messages and vocabularies. Here, I explore the existence of a growing vocabulary in the molecules and molecular functions of the microbial world. There are clear correspondences between the lexicon, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of language organization and the module, structure, function, and fitness paradigms of molecular biology. These correspondences are constrained by universal laws and engineering principles. Macromolecular structure, for example, follows quantitative linguistic patterns arising from statistical laws that are likely universal, including the Zipf's law, a special case of the scale-free distribution, the Heaps' law describing sublinear growth typical of economies of scales, and the Menzerath-Altmann's law, which imposes size-dependent patterns of decreasing returns. Trade-off solutions between principles of economy, flexibility, and robustness define a "triangle of persistence" describing the impact of the environment on a biological system. The pragmatic landscape of the triangle interfaces with the syntax and semantics of molecular languages, which together with comparative and evolutionary genomic data can explain global patterns of diversification of cellular life. The vocabularies of proteins (proteomes) and functions (functionomes) revealed a significant universal lexical core supporting a universal common ancestor, an ancestral evolutionary link between Bacteria and Eukarya, and distinct reductive evolutionary strategies of language compression in Archaea and Bacteria. A "causal" word cloud strategy inspired by the dependency grammar paradigm used in catenae unfolded the evolution of lexical units associated with Gene Ontology terms at different levels of ontological abstraction. While Archaea holds the smallest, oldest, and most homogeneous vocabulary of all superkingdoms, Bacteria heterogeneously apportions a more complex vocabulary, and Eukarya pushes functional innovation through mechanisms of flexibility and robustness.},

	Abstract = {Quorum sensing is the regulation of gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell-population density. Quorum sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules called autoinducers that increase in concentration as a function of cell density. The detection of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of an autoinducer leads to an alteration in gene expression. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing communication circuits to regulate a diverse array of physiological activities. These processes include symbiosis, virulence, competence, conjugation, antibiotic production, motility, sporulation, and biofilm formation. In general, Gram-negative bacteria use acylated homoserine lactones as autoinducers, and Gram-positive bacteria use processed oligo-peptides to communicate. Recent advances in the field indicate that cell-cell communication via autoinducers occurs both within and between bacterial species. Furthermore, there is mounting data suggesting that bacterial autoinducers elicit specific responses from host organisms. Although the nature of the chemical signals, the signal relay mechanisms, and the target genes controlled by bacterial quorum sensing systems differ, in every case the ability to communicate with one another allows bacteria to coordinate the gene expression, and therefore the behavior, of the entire community.

The evolution of quorum sensing systems in bacteria could, therefore, have been one of the early steps in the development of multicellularity.},

@article{Kaplan85,
	Abstract = {The enzymes for luminescence in Vibrio fischeri are induced by the accumulation of a species-specific metabolite (autoinducer) in the culture medium. Tritium-labeled autoinducer was used to study the mechanism of autoinduction. When 3H-autoinducer was added to suspensions of V. fischeri or Escherichia coli, cellular concentrations equaled external concentrations. For V. fischeri, equilibration of 3H-autoinducer was rapid (within 20 s), and greater than 90% of the cellular tritium remained in unmodified autoinducer. When V. fischeri or E. coli cells containing 3H-autoinducer were transferred to autoinducer-free buffer, 85 to 99.5% of the radiotracer escaped from the cells, depending on the strain. Concentrations of autoinducer as low as 10 nM, which is equivalent to 1 or 2 molecules per cell, were sufficient for induction, and the maximal response to autoinducer occurred at about 200 nM. If external autoinducer concentrations were decreased to below 10 nM after induction had commenced, the induction response did not continue. Based on this study, a model for autoinduction is described wherein autoinducer association with cells is by simple diffusion and binding of autoinducer to its active site is reversible.},

Evolutionary theory predicts that individuals who communicate and cooperate are vulnerable to cheaters, who either do not signal or fail to respond to signals. Experiments in colonies of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which signals between cells to regulate virulence factor expression, now confirm that both signal and signal-receptor mutants (or 'cheats') do have a fitness advantage. But a solution to the cheating problem does exist in the form of kin selection ---'honest' communication is favoured when it is between close relatives. The findings provide an explanation for the spread of cheats that has been observed in bacterial infections of humans.},

@article{Gestel15,
	Abstract = {The organization of cells, emerging from cell-cell interactions, can give rise to collective properties. These properties are adaptive when together cells can face environmental challenges that they separately cannot. One particular challenge that is important for microorganisms is migration. In this study, we show how flagellum-independent migration is driven by the division of labor of two cell types that appear during Bacillus subtilis sliding motility. Cell collectives organize themselves into bundles (called "van Gogh bundles") of tightly aligned cell chains that form filamentous loops at the colony edge. We show, by time-course microscopy, that these loops migrate by pushing themselves away from the colony. The formation of van Gogh bundles depends critically on the synergistic interaction of surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells. We propose that surfactin-producing cells reduce the friction between cells and their substrate, thereby facilitating matrix-producing cells to form bundles. The folding properties of these bundles determine the rate of colony expansion. Our study illustrates how the simple organization of cells within a community can yield a strong ecological advantage. This is a key factor underlying the diverse origins of multicellularity.},

	Abstract = {Recent attention to complex group-level behavior amongst bacteria has led some to conceive of multicellular clusters of bacteria as individuals. In this article, I assess these recent claims by first drawing a distinction between two concepts of individuality: physiological and evolutionary. I then survey cases that are representative of three different modes of growth: myxobacteria (surface-attached agglomerative growth), Bacillus subtilis (agglomerative growth not attached to a surface), and cyanobacteria (filamentous growth). A closer look at these cases indicates that multicellular individuality among bacteria is remarkably complex. Physiologically, the three cases of multicellular clusters do not form physiological individuals. But matters are different when it comes to evolutionary individuality; although multicellular clusters that grow by agglomeration are not highly individuated, filament-forming groups achieve a relatively high degree of individuality. I also suggest that debates about bacterial multicellular individuality may have been obscured by a failure to see that selection on highly individuated groups is by no means the only mechanism to bring about the complex group-level behaviors that have led some to view bacteria as multicellular individuals.},

	Abstract = {It is now widely accepted that microorganisms play many important roles in the lives of plants and animals. Every macroorganism has been shaped in some way by microorganisms. The recognition of the ubiquity and importance of microorganisms has led some to argue for a revolution in how we understand biological individuality and the primary units of natural selection. The term ``holobiont''was introduced as a name for the biological unit made up by a host and all of its associated microorganisms, and much of this new debate about biological individuality has focused on whether holobionts are integrated individuals or communities. In this paper, I show how parts of the holobiont can span both characterizations. I argue that most holobionts share more affinities with communities than they do with organisms, and that, except for maybe in rare cases, holobionts do not meet the criteria for being organisms, evolutionary individuals, or units of selection.},

@article{Yeh12,
	Abstract = {There is growing interest in understanding how kin selection drives the evolution of social behaviours in viscous populations. A key result, that has inspired much work on this topic, is the exact cancellation of the genetic relatedness and kin competition effects of dispersal in the simplest models of population viscosity, such that a reduction in the rate of dispersal neither promotes nor inhibits the evolution of helping behaviour. This theoretical result has been demonstrated for populations characterised by haploid, diploid and haplodiploid modes of inheritance. Here we develop a model of general ploidy that recovers these three scenarios as special cases and allows examination of scenarios that have not been considered previously. Specifically, we: clarify the importance of the implicit assumption of monandry in previous models; show that the cancellation result obtains in some models of ploidy but not in others; and reveal that the cancellation result obtains for different reasons in different models of ploidy. The cancellation result therefore hinges upon a population's genetic system as well as its demography.},

	Abstract = {Summary Cooperative systems are susceptible to invasion by selfish individuals that profit from receiving the social benefits but fail to contribute. These so-called ``cheaters'' can have a fitness advantage in the laboratory, but it is unclear whether cheating provides an important selective advantage in nature. We used a population genomic approach to examine the history of genes involved in cheating behaviors in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, testing whether these genes experience rapid evolutionary change as a result of conflict over spore-stalk fate. Candidate genes and surrounding regions showed elevated polymorphism, unusual patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and lower levels of population differentiation, but they did not show greater between-species divergence. The signatures were most consistent with frequency-dependent selection acting to maintain multiple alleles, suggesting that conflict may lead to stalemate rather than an escalating arms race. Our results reveal the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation and cheating and underscore how sequence-based approaches can be used to elucidate the history of conflicts that are difficult to observe directly.},

At 245 kilobases, Sulcia's genome is approximately one tenth of the smallest known Bacteroidetes genome and among the smallest for any cellular organism.

Genetic mutants that fail to perform a group-beneficial function but that reap the benefits of belonging to the group should have a within-group selective advantage, provided that the mutants are not too common. Here we show that social cheating exists even among prokaryotes. The bacterium Myxococcus xanthus exhibits several social behaviours, including aggregation of cells into spore-producing fruiting bodies during starvation. We examined a number of M. xanthus genotypes that were defective for fruiting-body development, including several lines that evolved for 1,000 generations under asocial conditions6 and others carrying defined mutations in developmental pathways7,8,9,10, to determine whether they behaved as cheaters when mixed with their developmentally proficient progenitor. Clones from several evolved lines and two defined mutants exhibited cheating during development, being over-represented among resulting spores relative to their initial frequency in the mixture. The ease of finding anti-social behaviours suggests that cheaters may be common in natural populations of  M. xanthus.},

	Abstract = {Summary The evolution of multicellular organisms represents one of approximately eight major evolutionary transitions that have occurred on earth [1, 2, 3, 4]. The major challenge raised by this transition is to explain why single cells should join together and become mutually dependent, in a way that leads to a more complex multicellular life form that can only replicate as a whole. It has been argued that a high genetic relatedness (r) between cells played a pivotal role in the evolutionary transition from single-celled to multicellular organisms, because it leads to reduced conflict and an alignment of interests between cells [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. We tested this hypothesis with a comparative study, comparing the form of multicellularity in species where groups are clonal (r = 1) to species where groups are potentially nonclonal (r ≤ 1). We found that species with clonal group formation were more likely to have undergone the major evolutionary transition to obligate multicellularity and had more cell types, a higher likelihood of sterile cells, and a trend toward higher numbers of cells in a group. More generally, our results unify the role of group formation and genetic relatedness across multiple evolutionary transitions and provide an unmistakable footprint of how natural selection has shaped the evolution of life [1].},

	Abstract = {The repeated evolution of multicellularity led to a wide diversity of organisms, many of which are sessile, including land plants, many fungi, and colonial animals. Sessile organisms adhere to a surface for most of their lives, where they grow and compete for space. Despite the prevalence of surface-associated multicellularity, little is known about its evolutionary origin. Here, we introduce a novel theoretical approach, based on spatial lineage tracking of cells, to study this origin. We show that multicellularity can rapidly evolve from two widespread cellular properties: cell adhesion and the regulatory control of adhesion. By evolving adhesion, cells attach to a surface, where they spontaneously give rise to primitive cell collectives that differ in size, life span, and mode of propagation. Selection in favor of large collectives increases the fraction of adhesive cells until a surface becomes fully occupied. Through kin recognition, collectives then evolve a central-peripheral polarity in cell adhesion that supports a division of labor between cells and profoundly impacts growth. Despite this spatial organization, nascent collectives remain cryptic, lack well-defined boundaries, and would require experimental lineage tracking technologies for their identification. Our results suggest that cryptic multicellularity could readily evolve and originate well before multicellular individuals become morphologically evident.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of modular colonial animals such as reef corals and bryozoans is enigmatic because of the ability for modules to proliferate asexually as whole colonies reproduce sexually. This reproductive duality creates an evolutionary tension between modules and colonies because selection operates at both levels. To understand how this evolutionary conflict is resolved, we compared the evolutionary potential of module- and colony-level traits in two species of the bryozoan Stylopoma, grown and bred in a common garden experiment. We find quantitatively distinct differences in the evolutionary potential of modular and colony traits. Contrary to solitary organisms, individual traits are not heritable from mother to daughter modules, but colony traits are strongly heritable from parent to offspring colonies. Colony-level evolution therefore dominates because no evolutionary change can accumulate among its modules.},

	Abstract = {A major challenge in evolutionary biology has been to explain the variation in multicellularity across the many independently evolved multicellular lineages, from slime moulds to vertebrates. Social evolution theory has highlighted the key role of relatedness in determining multicellular complexity and obligateness; however, there is a need to extend this to a broader perspective incorporating the role of the environment. In this paper, we formally test Bonner's 1998 hypothesis that the environment is crucial in determining the course of multicellular evolution, with aggregative multicellularity evolving more frequently on land and clonal multicellularity more frequently in water. Using a combination of scaling theory and phylogenetic comparative analyses, we describe multicellular organizational complexity across 139 species spanning 14 independent transitions to multicellularity and investigate the role of the environment in determining multicellular group formation and in imposing constraints on multicellular evolution. Our results, showing that the physical environment has impacted the way in which multicellular groups form, highlight that environmental conditions might have affected the major evolutionary transition to obligate multicellularity.},

	N2 = {ABSTRACT More than a century ago, William Morton Wheeler proposed that social insect colonies can be regarded as superorganisms when they have morphologically differentiated reproductive and nursing castes that are analogous to the metazoan germ-line and soma. Following the rise of sociobiology in the 1970s, Wheeler's insights were largely neglected, and we were left with multiple new superorganism concepts that are mutually inconsistent and uninformative on how superorganismality originated. These difficulties can be traced to the broadened sociobiological concept of eusociality, which denies that physical queen?worker caste differentiation is a universal hallmark of superorganismal colonies. Unlike early evolutionary naturalists and geneticists such as Weismann, Huxley, Fisher and Haldane, who set out to explain the acquisition of an unmated worker caste, the goal of sociobiology was to understand the evolution of eusociality, a broad-brush convenience category that covers most forms of cooperative breeding. By lumping a diverse spectrum of social systems into a single category, and drawing attention away from the evolution of distinct quantifiable traits, the sociobiological tradition has impeded straightforward connections between inclusive fitness theory and the major evolutionary transitions paradigm for understanding irreversible shifts to higher organizational complexity. We evaluate the history by which these inconsistencies accumulated, develop a common-cause approach for understanding the origins of all major transitions in eukaryote hierarchical complexity, and use Hamilton's rule to argue that they are directly comparable. We show that only Wheeler's original definition of superorganismality can be unambiguously linked to irreversible evolutionary transitions from context-dependent reproductive altruism to unconditional differentiation of permanently unmated castes in the ants, corbiculate bees, vespine wasps and higher termites. We argue that strictly monogamous parents were a necessary, albeit not sufficient condition for all transitions to superorganismality, analogous to single-zygote bottlenecking being a necessary but not sufficient condition for the convergent origins of complex soma across multicellular eukaryotes. We infer that conflict reduction was not a necessary condition for the origin of any of these major transitions, and conclude that controversies over the status of inclusive fitness theory primarily emanate from the arbitrarily defined sociobiological concepts of superorganismality and eusociality, not from the theory itself.},

This trade-off may result in an evolutionary dilemma, because cells with a higher rate but lower yield of ATP production may gain a selective advantage when competing for shared energy resources. Using an analysis of model simulations and biochemical observations, we show that ATP production with a low rate and high yield can be viewed as a form of cooperative resource use and may evolve in spatially structured environments. Furthermore, we argue that the high ATP yield of respiration may have facilitated the evolutionary transition from unicellular to undifferentiated multicellular organisms.},

The concept of `elementary flux modes'provides a mathematical tool to define and comprehensively describe all metabolic routes that are both stoichiometrically and thermodynamically feasible for a group of enzymes. We have used this concept to analyze the interplay between the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and glycolysis. The set of elementary modes for this system involves conventional glycolysis, a futile cycle, all the modes of PPP function described in biochemistry textbooks, and additional modes that are a priori equally entitled to pathway status. Applications include maximizing product yield in amino acid and antibiotic synthesis, reconstruction and consistency checks of metabolism from genome data, analysis of enzyme deficiencies, and drug target identification in metabolic networks.},

	Abstract = {The relationship between structure, function and regulation in complex cellular networks is a still largely open question1,2,3. Systems biology aims to explain this relationship by combining experimental and theoretical approaches4. Current theories have various strengths and shortcomings in providing an integrated, predictive description of cellular networks. Specifically, dynamic mathematical modelling of large-scale networks meets difficulties because the necessary mechanistic detail and kinetic parameters are rarely available. In contrast, structure-oriented analyses only require network topology, which is well known in many cases. Previous approaches of this type focus on network robustness5 or metabolic phenotype2,6, but do not give predictions on cellular regulation. Here, we devise a theoretical method for simultaneously predicting key aspects of network functionality, robustness and gene regulation from network structure alone. This is achieved by determining and analysing the non-decomposable pathways able to operate coherently at steady state (elementary flux modes). We use the example of Escherichia coli central metabolism to illustrate the method.},

In particular, what are the energy budgets of cells? What are the constraints and limits energy flows impose on cellular processes? Do cells operate near these limits, and if so how do energetic constraints impact cellular functions? Physics has provided many tools to study nonequilibrium systems and to define physical limits, but applying these tools to cell biology remains a challenge. Physical bioenergetics, which resides at the interface of nonequilibrium physics, energy metabolism, and cell biology, seeks to understand how much energy cells are using, how they partition this energy between different cellular processes, and the associated energetic constraints.

@article{Angeles-Martinez21,
	Abstract = {Microorganisms are frequently organized into crowded structures that affect the nutrients diffusion. This reduction in metabolite diffusion could modify the microbial dynamics, meaning that computational methods for studying microbial systems need accurate ways to model the crowding conditions. We previously developed a computational framework, termed CROMICS, that incorporates the effect of the (time-dependent) crowding conditions on the spatio-temporal modeling of microbial communities, and we used it to demonstrate the crowding influence on the community dynamics. To further identify scenarios where crowding should be considered in microbial modeling, we herein applied and extended CROMICS to simulate several environmental conditions that could potentially boost or dampen the crowding influence in biofilms. We explore whether the nutrient supply (rich- or low-nutrient media), the cell-packing configuration (square or hexagonal spherical cell arrangement), or the cell growing conditions (planktonic state or biofilm) modify the crowding influence on the growth of Escherichia coli. Our results indicate that the growth rate, the abundance and appearance time of different cell phenotypes as well as the amount of by-products secreted to the medium are sensitive to some extent to the local crowding conditions in all scenarios tested, except in rich-nutrient media. Crowding conditions enhance the formation of nutrient gradient in biofilms, but its effect is only appreciated when cell metabolism is controlled by the nutrient limitation. Thus, as soon as biomass (and/or any other extracellular macromolecule) accumulates in a region, and cells occupy more than 14{\%} of the volume fraction, the crowding effect must not be underestimated, as the microbial dynamics start to deviate from the ideal/expected behaviour that assumes volumeless cells or when a homogeneous (reduced) diffusion is applied in the simulation. The modeling and simulation of the interplay between the species diversity (cell shape and metabolism) and the environmental conditions (nutrient quality, crowding conditions) can help to design effective strategies for the optimization and control of microbial systems.},

It is currently unclear how micronutrient scarcity affects cellular processes and how interdependence across micronutrients arises. We show that proximate causes of micronutrient growth limitation and interdependence are governed by cumulative cellular costs of acquiring and using micronutrients. Using a mechanistic proteomic allocation model of a polar diatom focused on iron and manganese, we demonstrate how cellular processes fundamentally underpin micronutrient limitation, and how they interact and compensate for each other to shape cellular elemental stoichiometry and resource interdependence. We coupled our model with metaproteomic and environmental data, yielding an approach for estimating biogeochemical metrics, including taxon-specific growth rates. Our results show that cumulative cellular costs govern how environmental conditions modify phytoplankton growth.},

@article{Hui15,
	Abstract = {A central aim of cell biology was to understand the strategy of gene expression in response to the environment. Here, we study gene expression response to metabolic challenges in exponentially growing Escherichia coli using mass spectrometry. Despite enormous complexity in the details of the underlying regulatory network, we find that the proteome partitions into several coarse-grained sectors, with each sector's total mass abundance exhibiting positive or negative linear relations with the growth rate. The growth rate-dependent components of the proteome fractions comprise about half of the proteome by mass, and their mutual dependencies can be characterized by a simple flux model involving only two effective parameters. The success and apparent generality of this model arises from tight coordination between proteome partition and metabolism, suggesting a principle for resource allocation in proteome economy of the cell. This strategy of global gene regulation should serve as a basis for future studies on gene expression and constructing synthetic biological circuits. Coarse graining may be an effective approach to derive predictive phenomenological models for other 'omics' studies.},

Acetate as well as other weak acids such as 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidenedione can therefore be used as a probe of internal pH in these mutants. The intracellular pH was maintained at about 7.1 in darkness and 7.6 in light when external pH was varied from 6.8--8.0 No carrier involved in acetic acid equilibration could be demonstrated. Of other organic acids investigated, only propionate distributed in accordance with pH differences between the cells and surrounding fluid.

Besides residing in freshwater and marine anoxic sediments and soils, microbes capable of syntrophic metabolism also have been observed in more extreme habitats, including acidic soils, alkaline soils, thermal springs, and permanently cold soils, demonstrating that syntrophy is a widely distributed metabolic process in nature.

	Abstract = {Classical definitions of syntrophy focus on a process, performed through metabolic interaction between dependent microbial partners, such as the degradation of complex organic compounds under anoxic conditions. However, examples from past and current scientific discoveries suggest that a new, simple but wider definition is necessary to cover all aspects of microbial syntrophy. We suggest the term `obligately mutualistic metabolism', which still focuses on microbial metabolic cooperation but also includes an ecological aspect: the benefit for both partners. By the combined metabolic activity of microorganisms, endergonic reactions can become exergonic through the efficient removal of products and therefore enable a microbial community to survive with minimal energy resources. Here, we explain the principles of classical and non-classical syntrophy and illustrate the concepts with various examples. We present biochemical fundamentals that allow microorganism to survive under a range of environmental conditions and to drive important biogeochemical processes. Novel technologies have contributed to the understanding of syntrophic relationships in cultured and uncultured systems. Recent research highlights that obligately mutualistic metabolism is not limited to certain metabolic pathways nor to certain environments or microorganisms. This beneficial microbial interaction is not restricted to the transfer of reducing agents such as hydrogen or formate, but can also involve the exchange of organic, sulfurous- and nitrogenous compounds or the removal of toxic compounds.},

	Abstract = {The stability and function of a microbial community depends on nutritional interactions among community members such as the cross-feeding of essential small molecules synthesized by a subset of the population. In this review, we describe examples of microbe--microbe and microbe--host cofactor cross-feeding, a type of interaction that influences the forms of metabolism carried out within a community. Cofactor cross-feeding can contribute to both the health and nutrition of a host organism, the virulence and persistence of pathogens, and the composition and function of environmental communities. By examining the impact of shared cofactors on microbes from pure culture to natural communities, we stand to gain a better understanding of the interactions that link microbes together, which may ultimately be a key to developing strategies for manipulating microbial communities with human health, agricultural, and environmental implications.},

	Abstract = {Bacterial feeding has evolved toward specific evolutionary niches and the sources of energy differ between species and strains. Although bacteria fundamentally compete for nutrients, the excreted products from one strain may be the preferred energy source or a source of essential nutrients for another strain. The large variability in feeding preferences between bacterial strains often provides for complex cross-feeding relationships between bacteria, particularly in complex environments such as the human lower gut, which impacts on the host's digestion and nutrition. Although a large amount of information is available on cross-feeding between bacterial strains, it is important to consider the evolution of cross-feeding. Adaptation to environmental stimuli is a continuous process, thus understanding the evolution of microbial cross-feeding interactions allows us to determine the resilience of microbial populations to changes to this environment, such as changes in nutrient supply, and how new interactions might emerge in the future. In this review, we provide a framework of terminology dividing bacterial cross-feeding into four forms that can be used for the classification and analysis of cross-feeding dynamics. Under the proposed framework, we discuss the evolutionary origins for the four forms of cross-feeding and factors such as spatial structure that influence their emergence and subsequent persistence. This review draws from both the theoretical and experimental evolutionary literature to provide a cross-disciplinary perspective on the evolution of different types of cross-feeding.},

In past work, we had predicted that 58 cross-feeding interactions could evolve in populations of E. coli grown in glucose minimal media, yet only two have been experimentally observed, those involving acetate and glycerol. We hypothesized that multiple mutations might be required for the evolution of computationally predicted but not experimentally observed cross-feeding interactions. To answer this question, we developed a method that searches for the minimal number of metabolic changes required for individuals to change their metabolic state (from an ancestral glucose-consuming state to an evolved state that produces or consumes other metabolite). We observed that the metabolic changes required for the evolution of acetate and glycerol cross-feeding are no less complex than those required for the evolution of the other predicted cross-feeding interactions, which suggests that multiple cross-feeding interactions may still await discovery.},

	Abstract = {SUMMARY: When Saccharomyces cerevisiae is growing exponentially on glucose or fructose as carbon plus energy source, and in the presence of air, the glucose degradation proceeds mainly via aerobic fermentation. When the yeast is growing on mannose or galactose, degradation proceeds simultaneously via respiration and fermentation. This situation results from a repression of the of the respiratory enzymes synthesis by high fermentation rates. This regulatory system, called the ``Crabtree effect'', consists actually of a repression of an energy source (respiration) by another energy source (fermentation). Various yeast strains were tested; the regulatory system was present in about 50% of them.},

	Abstract = {Diversity is a fundamental, yet threatened, property of ecological systems. The idea that diversity can itself favour diversification, in an autocatalytic process, is very appealing but remains controversial. Here, we study a generalized model of ecological communities and investigate how the level of initial diversity influences the possibility of evolutionary diversification. We show that even simple models of intra- and inter-specific ecological interactions can predict a positive effect of diversity on diversification: adaptive radiations may require a threshold number of species before kicking-off. We call this phenomenon DDAR (diversity-dependent adaptive radiations) and identify mathematically two distinct pathways connecting diversity to diversification, involving character displacement and the positive diversity-productivity relationship. Our results may explain observed delays in adaptive radiations at the macroscale and diversification patterns reported in experimental microbial communities, and shed new light on the dynamics of ecological diversity, the diversity-dependence of diversification rates, and the consequences of biodiversity loss.},

According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species'productivity responses to environmental fluctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental fluctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes.},

@article{Baquero21,
	Abstract = {Niches are spaces for the biological units of selection, from cells to complex communities. In a broad sense, "species" are biological units of individuation. Niches do not exist without individual organisms, and every organism has a niche. We use "niche" in the Hutchinsonian sense as an abstraction of a multidimensional environmental space characterized by a variety of conditions, both biotic and abiotic, whose quantitative ranges determine the positive or negative growth rates of the microbial individual, typically a species, but also parts of the communities of species contained in this space. Microbial organisms ("species") constantly diversify, and such diversification (radiation) depends on the possibility of opening up unexploited or insufficiently exploited niches. Niche exploitation frequently implies "niche construction," as the colonized niche evolves with time, giving rise to new potential subniches, thereby influencing the selection of a series of new variants in the progeny. The evolution of niches and organisms is the result of reciprocal interacting processes that form a single unified process. Centrifugal microbial diversification expands the limits of the species' niches while a centripetal or cohesive process occurs simultaneously, mediated by horizontal gene transfers and recombinatorial events, condensing all of the information recovered during the diversifying specialization into "novel organisms" (possible future species), thereby creating a more complex niche, where the selfishness of the new organism(s) establishes a "homeostatic power" limiting the niche's variation. Once the niche's full carrying capacity has been reached, reproductive isolation occurs, as no foreign organisms can outcompete the established population/community, thereby facilitating speciation. In the case of individualization-speciation of the microbiota, its contribution to the animal' gut structure is a type of "niche construction," the result of crosstalk between the niche (host) and microorganism(s). Lastly, there is a parallelism between the hierarchy of niches and that of microbial individuals. The increasing anthropogenic effects on the biosphere (such as globalization) might reduce the diversity of niches and bacterial individuals, with the potential emergence of highly transmissible multispecialists (which are eventually deleterious) resulting from the homogenization of the microbiosphere, a possibility that should be explored and prevented.},

@article{Vazquez08b,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obtaining quantitative predictions for cellular metabolic activities requires the identification and modeling of the physicochemical constraints that are relevant at physiological growth conditions. Molecular crowding in a cell's cytoplasm is one such potential constraint, as it limits the solvent capacity available to metabolic enzymes. RESULTS: Using a recently introduced flux balance modeling framework (FBAwMC) here we demonstrate that this constraint determines a metabolic switch in E. coli cells when they are shifted from low to high growth rates. The switch is characterized by a change in effective optimization strategy, the excretion of acetate at high growth rates, and a global reorganization of E. coli metabolic fluxes, the latter being partially confirmed by flux measurements of central metabolic reactions. CONCLUSION: These results implicate the solvent capacity as an important physiological constraint acting on E. coli cells operating at high metabolic rates and for the activation of a metabolic switch when they are shifted from low to high growth rates. The relevance of this constraint in the context of both the aerobic ethanol excretion seen in fast growing yeast cells (Crabtree effect) and the aerobic glycolysis observed in rapidly dividing cancer cells (Warburg effect) should be addressed in the future.},

	Abstract = {Overflow metabolism in the form of aerobic acetate excretion by Escherichia coli is an important physiological characteristic of this common industrial microorganism. Although acetate formation occurs under conditions of high glucose consumption, the genetic mechanisms that trigger this phenomenon are not clearly understood. We report on the role of the NADH/NAD ratio (redox ratio) in overflow metabolism. We modulated the redox ratio in E. coli through the expression of Streptococcus pneumoniae (water-forming) NADH oxidase. Using steady-state chemostat cultures, we demonstrated a strong correlation between acetate formation and this redox ratio. We furthermore completed genome-wide transcription analyses of a control E. coli strain and an E. coli strain overexpressing NADH oxidase. The transcription results showed that in the control strain, several genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and respiration were repressed as the glucose consumption rate increased. Moreover, the relative repression of these genes was alleviated by expression of NADH oxidase and the resulting reduced redox ratio. Analysis of a promoter binding site upstream of the genes which correlated with redox ratio revealed a degenerate sequence with strong homology with the binding site for ArcA. Deletion of arcA resulted in acetate reduction and increased the biomass yield due to the increased capacities of the TCA cycle and respiration. Acetate formation was completely eliminated by reducing the redox ratio through expression of NADH oxidase in the arcA mutant, even at a very high glucose consumption rate. The results provide a basis for studying new regulatory mechanisms prevalent at reduced NADH/NAD ratios, as well as for designing more efficient bioprocesses.},

@article{Molenaar09,
	Abstract = {The growth rate-dependent regulation of cell size, ribosomal content, and metabolic efficiency follows a common pattern in unicellular organisms: with increasing growth rates, cell size and ribosomal content increase and a shift to energetically inefficient metabolism takes place. The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.},

@article{Renilla12,
	Abstract = {Impairment of acetate production in Escherichia coli is crucial for the performance of many biotechnological processes. Aerobic production of acetate (or acetate overflow) results from changes in the expression of central metabolism genes. Acetyl−CoA synthetase scavenges extracellular acetate in glucose-limited cultures. Once converted to acetyl−CoA, it can be catabolized by the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the glyoxylate pathway. In this work, we assessed the significance of these pathways on acetate overflow during glucose excess and limitation. Gene expression, enzyme activities, and metabolic fluxes were studied in E. coli knock-out mutants related to the glyoxylate pathway operon and its regulators. The relevance of post-translational regulation by AceK-mediated phosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase for pathway functionality was underlined. In chemostat cultures performed at increasing dilution rates, acetate overflow occurs when growing over a threshold glucose uptake rate. This threshold was not affected in a glyoxylate-pathway-deficient strain (lacking isocitrate lyase, the first enzyme of the pathway), indicating that it is not relevant for acetate overflow. In carbon-limited chemostat cultures, gluconeogenesis (maeB, sfcA, and pck), the glyoxylate operon and, especially, acetyl−CoA synthetase are upregulated. A mutant in acs (encoding acetyl−CoA synthetase) produced acetate at all dilution rates. This work demonstrates that, in E. coli, acetate production occurs at all dilution rates and that overflow is the result of unbalanced synthesis and scavenging activities. The over-expression of acetyl−CoA synthetase by cAMP−CRP-dependent induction limits this phenomenon in cultures consuming glucose at low rate, ensuring the recycling of the acetyl−CoA and acetyl−phosphate pools, although establishing an energy-dissipating substrate cycle.},

Here we propose that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new cell. Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. A better understanding of the mechanistic links between cellular metabolism and growth control may ultimately lead to better treatments for human cancer.},

@article{Valgepea10,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The biotechnology industry has extensively exploited Escherichia coli for producing recombinant proteins, biofuels etc. However, high growth rate aerobic E. coli cultivations are accompanied by acetate excretion i.e. overflow metabolism which is harmful as it inhibits growth, diverts valuable carbon from biomass formation and is detrimental for target product synthesis. Although overflow metabolism has been studied for decades, its regulation mechanisms still remain unclear. RESULTS: In the current work, growth rate dependent acetate overflow metabolism of E. coli was continuously monitored using advanced continuous cultivation methods (A-stat and D-stat). The first step in acetate overflow switch (at μ = 0.27 $\pm$ 0.02 h(-1)) is the repression of acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs) activity triggered by carbon catabolite repression resulting in decreased assimilation of acetate produced by phosphotransacetylase (Pta), and disruption of the PTA-ACS node. This was indicated by acetate synthesis pathways PTA-ACKA and POXB component expression down-regulation before the overflow switch at μ = 0.27 $\pm$ 0.02 h(-1) with concurrent 5-fold stronger repression of acetate-consuming Acs. This in turn suggests insufficient Acs activity for consuming all the acetate produced by Pta, leading to disruption of the acetate cycling process in PTA-ACS node where constant acetyl phosphate or acetate regeneration is essential for E. coli chemotaxis, proteolysis, pathogenesis etc. regulation. In addition, two-substrate A-stat and D-stat experiments showed that acetate consumption capability of E. coli decreased drastically, just as Acs expression, before the start of overflow metabolism. The second step in overflow switch is the sharp decline in cAMP production at μ = 0.45 h(-1) leading to total Acs inhibition and fast accumulation of acetate. CONCLUSION: This study is an example of how a systems biology approach allowed to propose a new regulation mechanism for overflow metabolism in E. coli shown by proteomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic levels coupled to two-phase acetate accumulation: acetate overflow metabolism in E. coli is triggered by Acs down-regulation resulting in decreased assimilation of acetic acid produced by Pta, and disruption of the PTA-ACS node.},

Despite extensive research, the biochemical basis for this phenomenon remains obscure. We hypothesize that the outcome of a competition for membrane space between glucose transporters and respiratory chain (which we refer to as economics of membrane occupancy) proteins influences respiration and fermentation. By incorporating a sole constraint based on this concept in the genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli, we were able to simulate respiro-fermentation. Further analysis of the impact of this constraint revealed differential utilization of the cytochromes and faster glucose uptake under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. Based on these simulations, we propose that bacterial cells manage the composition of their cytoplasmic membrane to maintain optimal ATP production by switching between oxidative and substrate-level phosphorylation. These results suggest that the membrane occupancy constraint may be a fundamental governing constraint of cellular metabolism and physiology, and establishes a direct link between cell morphology and physiology.},

	Abstract = {Cells usually respond to changing growth conditions with a change in the specific growth rate (μ) and adjustment of their proteome to adapt and maintain metabolic efficiency. Description of the principles behind proteome resource allocation is important for understanding metabolic regulation in response to changing μ. Thus, we analysed the proteome resource allocation dynamics of Escherichia coli into different metabolic processes in response to changing μ. E. coli was grown on minimal and defined rich media in steady state continuous cultures at different μ and characterised combining two LC-MS/MS-based proteomics methods: stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and intensity based label-free absolute quantification. We detected slowly growing cells investing more proteome resources in energy generation and carbohydrate transport and metabolism whereas for achieving faster growth cells needed to devote most resources to translation and processes closely related to the protein synthesis pipeline. Furthermore, down-regulation of energy generation and carbohydrate metabolism proteins with faster growth displayed very similar expression dynamics with the global transcriptional regulator CRP (cyclic AMP receptor protein), pointing to a dominant protein resource allocating role of this protein. Our data also suggest that acetate overflow may be the result of global proteome resource optimisation as cells saved proteome resources by switching from fully respiratory to respiro-fermentative growth. The presented results give a quantitative overview of how E. coli adjusts its proteome to achieve faster growth and in future could contribute to the design of more efficient cell factories through proteome optimisation.},

@article{Zeng19,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The formation of acetate by fast-growing Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a commonly observed phenomenon, often referred to as overflow metabolism. Among various studies that have been carried over decades, a recent work (Basan, M. et al. Nature 528, 99-104, 2015) suggested and validated that it is the differential proteomic efficiencies in energy biogenesis between fermentation and respiration that lead to the production of acetate at rapid growth conditions, as the consequence of optimally allocating the limited proteomic resource. In the current work, we attempt to incorporate this newly developed proteome allocation theory into flux balance analysis (FBA) to capture quantitatively the extent of overflow metabolism in different E. coli strains. RESULTS: A concise constraint was introduced into a FBA-based model with three proteomic cost parameters to represent constrained allocation of proteome over two energy (respiration and fermentation) pathways and biomass synthesis. Linear relationships were shown to exist between the three proteomic cost parameters. Tests with three different strains revealed that the proteomic cost of fermentation was consistently lower than that of respiration. A slow-growing strain appeared to have a higher proteomic cost for biomass synthesis than fast-growing strains. Different assumed levels of carbon flowing into pentose phosphate pathway affected the absolute value of model parameters, but had no qualitative impact on the comparative proteomic costs. For the prediction of biomass yield, significant errors that occurred for one of the tested strains (ML308) were rectified by adjusting the cellular energy demand according to literature data. CONCLUSIONS: With the aid of a concise proteome allocation constraint, our FBA-based model is able to quantitatively predict the onset and extent of the overflow metabolism in various E. coli strains. Such prediction is enabled by three linearly-correlated (as opposed to uniquely determinable) proteomic cost parameters. The linear relationships between these parameters, when determined using data from cell culturing experiments, render biologically meaningful comparative proteomic costs between fermentation and respiration pathways and between the biomass synthesis sectors of slow- and fast-growing species. Simultaneous prediction of acetate production and biomass yield in the overflow region requires the use of reliable cellular energy demand data.},

@article{Szenk17,
	Abstract = {Bacteria and other cells show a puzzling behavior. At high growth rates, E. coli switch from respiration (which is ATP-efficient) to using fermentation for additional ATP (which is inefficient). This overflow metabolism results in a several-fold decrease in ATP produced per glucose molecule provided as food. By integrating diverse types of experimental data into a simple biophysical model, we give evidence that this onset is the result of the membrane real estate hypothesis: Fast growth drives cells to be bigger, reducing their surface-to-volume ratios. This decreases the membrane area available for respiratory proteins despite growing demand, causing increased crowding. Only when respiratory proteins reach their crowding limit does the cell activate fermentation, since fermentation allows faster ATP production per unit membrane area. Surface limitation thus creates a Pareto trade-off between membrane efficiency and ATP yield that links metabolic choice to the size and shape of a bacterial cell. By exploring the predictions that emerge from this trade-off, we show how consideration of molecular structures, energetics, rates, and equilibria can provide important insight into cellular behavior.},

@article{Basan15,
	Abstract = {Overflow metabolism refers to the seemingly wasteful strategy in which cells use fermentation instead of the more efficient respiration to generate energy, despite the availability of oxygen. Known as the Warburg effect in the context of cancer growth, this phenomenon occurs ubiquitously for fast-growing cells, including bacteria, fungi and mammalian cells, but its origin has remained unclear despite decades of research. Here we study metabolic overflow in Escherichia coli, and show that it is a global physiological response used to cope with changing proteomic demands of energy biogenesis and biomass synthesis under different growth conditions. A simple model of proteomic resource allocation can quantitatively account for all of the observed behaviours, and accurately predict responses to new perturbations. The key hypothesis of the model, that the proteome cost of energy biogenesis by respiration exceeds that by fermentation, is quantitatively confirmed by direct measurement of protein abundances via quantitative mass spectrometry.},

	Abstract = {We assess the degree to which adaptation to a uniform environment among independently evolving asexual populations is associated with increasing divergence of those populations. In addition, we are concerned with the pattern of adaptation itself, particularly whether the rate of increase in mean fitness tends to decline with the number of generations of selection in a constant environment. The correspondence between the rate of increase in mean fitness and the within-population genetic variance of fitness, as expected from Fisher's fundamental theorem, is also addressed. Twelve Escherichia coli populations were founded from a single clonal ancestor and allowed to evolve for 2,000 generations. Mean fitness increased by about 37{\%}. However, the rate of increase in mean fitness was slower in later generations. There was no statistically significant within-population genetic variance of fitness, but there was significant between-population variance. Although the estimated genetic variation in fitness within populations was not statistically significant, it was consistent in magnitude with theoretical expectations. Similarly, the variance of mean fitness between populations was consistent with a model that incorporated stochastic variation in the timing and order of substitutions at a finite number of nonepistatic loci, coupled with substitutional delays and interference between substitutions arising from clonality. These results, taken as a whole, are consistent with theoretical expectations that do not invoke divergence due to multiple fitness peaks in a Wrightian evolutionary landscape.},

Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for \&gt;30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in experiments that ``replayed''evolution from different points in that population's history. We observed no Cit+ mutants among 8.4 ×1012 ancestral cells, nor among 9 ×1012 cells from 60 clones sampled in the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of this phenotype was contingent on the particular history of that population. More generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.},

	Abstract = {Differential cell adhesion, mediated by e.g. integrin and cadherins/catenines, plays an important role in morphogenesis and it has been shown that there is intimate cross-talk between their expression and modification, and inter-cellular signalling, cell differentiation, cell growth and apoptosis. In this paper, we introduce and use a formal model to explore the morphogenetic potential of the interplay between these processes. We demonstrate the formation of interesting morphologies. Initiated by cell differentiation, differential cell adhesion leads to a long transient of cell migrations, e.g. engulfing and intercalation of cells and cell layers. This transient can be sustained dynamically by further cell differentiation, and by cell growth/division and cell death which are triggered by the (also long range) forces (stretching and squeezing) generated by the cell adhesion. We study the interrelation between modes of cell differentiation and modes of morphogenesis. We use an evolutionary process to zoom in on gene-regulation networks which lead to cell differentiation. Morphogenesis is not selected for but appears as a side-effect. The evolutionary dynamics shows the hallmarks of evolution on a rugged landscape, including long neutral paths. We show that a combinatorially large set of morphologies occurs in the vicinity of a neutral path which sustains cell differentiation. Thus, an almost linear molecular phylogeny gives rise to mosaic evolution on the morphological level.},

This observation suggests that there are certain features of biological systems that give them a high tolerance (i.e. robustness) towards gene loss. We still lack an exact understanding of what these features might be and how they could have been acquired during evolution. Here, we offer a possible answer for these questions in the context of metabolic networks. Using mathematical models capturing the structure and dynamics of metabolic networks, we simulate their evolution under stable and fluctuating environments (i.e., available metabolites). We find that the latter scenario leads to evolution of metabolic networks that display high robustness against gene loss. This robustness of in silico evolved networks is underlined by an increased number of multifunctional enzymes and independent paths leading from initial metabolites to biomass. These findings provide evidence that fluctuating environments can be a major evolutionary force leading to the emergence of robustness as a side effect. A direct prediction resulting from this study is that organisms living in stable and fluctuating environments should display differing levels of robustness against gene loss.},

Although the study of evolvability offers new insights into many important biological questions, the conceptual bases of evolvability, and the mechanisms of its evolution, remain controversial. We used simulated evolution of a model of gene network dynamics to test the contentious hypothesis that natural selection can favour high evolvability, in particular in sexual populations. Our results conclusively demonstrate that fluctuating natural selection can increase the capacity of model gene networks to adapt to new environments. Detailed studies of the evolutionary dynamics of these networks establish a broad range of validity for this result and quantify the evolutionary forces responsible for changes in evolvability. Analysis of the genotype?phenotype map of these networks also reveals mechanisms connecting evolvability, genetic architecture and robustness. Our results suggest that the evolution of evolvability can have a pervasive influence on many aspects of organisms.},

On the one hand, it would seem to impede adaptation by making it less easy for a new phenotype to develop in the event of environmental changes; on the other it is surely advantageous for an organism to buffer its phenotype against possibly unhelpful mutations. How can an organism handle this paradox, and be both robust and adaptable? A quantitative population genetics model gives a possible resolution to this problem, by showing that mutational robustness can either impede or facilitate adaptation, depending on the population size, the mutation rate and the structure of the fitness landscape.},

Here we have generated two classes of digital organism: simple programs selected solely for rapid replication, and complex programs selected to perform mathematical operations that accelerate replication through a set of defined `metabolic'rewards. To examine the differences in their genetic architecture, we introduced millions of single and multiple mutations into each organism and measured the effects on the organism's fitness. The complex organisms are more robust than the simple ones with respect to the average effects of single mutations. Interactions among mutations are common and usually yield higher fitness than predicted from the component mutations assuming multiplicative effects; such interactions are especially important in the complex organisms. Frequent interactions among mutations have also been seen in bacteria, fungi and fruitflies4,5,6. Our findings support the view that interactions are a general feature of genetic systems7,8,9.},

	Abstract = {High mutation rates select for the evolution of mutational robustness where populations inhabit flat fitness peaks with little epistasis, protecting them from lethal mutagenesis. Recent evidence suggests that a different effect protects small populations from extinction via the accumulation of deleterious mutations. In drift robustness, populations tend to occupy peaks with steep flanks and positive epistasis between mutations. However, it is not known what happens when mutation rates are high and population sizes are small at the same time. Using a simple fitness model with variable epistasis, we show that the equilibrium fitness has a minimum as a function of the parameter that tunes epistasis, implying that this critical point is an unstable fixed point for evolutionary trajectories. In agent-based simulations of evolution at finite mutation rate, we demonstrate that when mutations can change epistasis, trajectories with a subcritical value of epistasis evolve to decrease epistasis, while those with supercritical initial points evolve towards higher epistasis. These two fixed points can be identified with mutational and drift robustness, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Darwinian evolution favours genotypes with high replication rates, a process called `survival of the fittest'. However, knowing the replication rate of each individual genotype may not suffice to predict the eventual survivor, even in an asexual population. According to quasi-species theory, selection favours the cloud of genotypes, interconnected by mutation, whose average replication rate is highest1,2,3,4,5. Here we confirm this prediction using digital organisms that self-replicate, mutate and evolve6,7,8,9. Forty pairs of populations were derived from 40 different ancestors in identical selective environments, except that one of each pair experienced a 4-fold higher mutation rate. In 12 cases, the dominant genotype that evolved at the lower mutation rate achieved a replication rate >1.5-fold faster than its counterpart. We allowed each of these disparate pairs to compete across a range of mutation rates. In each case, as mutation rate was increased, the outcome of competition switched to favour the genotype with the lower replication rate. These genotypes, although they occupied lower fitness peaks, were located in flatter regions of the fitness surface and were therefore more robust with respect to mutations.},

Though of similar importance, the reversible Michaelis--Menten scheme is not as well characterized. This is a serious limitation since even enzymatic reactions that go to completion may be reversible. The current work derives a total quasi-steady-state approximation (tQSSA) for the reversible Michaelis--Menten and delineates its validity domain. The tQSSA allows the derivation of uniformly valid approximations for the limit of low enzyme concentrations, ET⪡ST+KM, and under certain more restrictive conditions also for high enzyme concentrations such that ST⪡ET+KM. Using these simple analytical approximations, a sequential experimental--theoretical method is suggested for unambiguously estimating all the kinetic parameters of the reversible Michaelis--Menten scheme.},

@article{Chen10,
	Abstract = {Recent interest in modeling biochemical networks raises questions about the relationship between often complex mathematical models and familiar arithmetic concepts from classical enzymology, and also about connections between modeling and experimental data. This review addresses both topics by familiarizing readers with key concepts (and terminology) in the construction, validation, and application of deterministic biochemical models, with particular emphasis on a simple enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Networks of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are the natural language for describing enzyme kinetics in a mass action approximation. We illustrate this point by showing how the familiar Briggs-Haldane formulation of Michaelis-Menten kinetics derives from the outer (or quasi-steady-state) solution of a dynamical system of ODEs describing a simple reaction under special conditions. We discuss how parameters in the Michaelis-Menten approximation and in the underlying ODE network can be estimated from experimental data, with a special emphasis on the origins of uncertainty. Finally, we extrapolate from a simple reaction to complex models of multiprotein biochemical networks. The concepts described in this review, hitherto of interest primarily to practitioners, are likely to become important for a much broader community of cellular and molecular biologists attempting to understand the promise and challenges of "systems biology" as applied to biochemical mechanisms.},

The cases in point include the origin of complex RNA molecules and protein folds; major groups of viruses; archaea and bacteria, and the principal lineages within each of these prokaryotic domains; eukaryotic supergroups; and animal phyla. In each of these pivotal nexuses in life's history, the principal "types" seem to appear rapidly and fully equipped with the signature features of the respective new level of biological organization. No intermediate "grades" or intermediate forms between different types are detectable.

@article{Knibbe07b,
	Abstract = {A significant part of eukaryotic noncoding DNA is viewed as the passive result of mutational processes, such as the proliferation of mobile elements. However, sequences lacking an immediate utility can nonetheless play a major role in the long-term evolvability of a lineage, for instance by promoting genomic rearrangements. They could thus be subject to an indirect selection. Yet, such a long-term effect is difficult to isolate either in vivo or in vitro. Here, by performing in silico experimental evolution, we demonstrate that, under low mutation rates, the indirect selection of variability promotes the accumulation of noncoding sequences: Even in the absence of self-replicating elements and mutational bias, noncoding sequences constituted an important fraction of the evolved genome because the indirectly selected genomes were those that were variable enough to discover beneficial mutations. On the other hand, high mutation rates lead to compact genomes, much like the viral ones, although no selective cost of genome size was applied: The indirectly selected genomes were those that were small enough for the genetic information to be reliably transmitted. Thus, the spontaneous evolution of the amount of noncoding DNA strongly depends on the mutation rate. Our results suggest the existence of an additional pressure on the amount of noncoding DNA, namely the indirect selection of an appropriate trade-off between the fidelity of the transmission of the genetic information and the exploration of the mutational neighborhood. Interestingly, this trade-off resulted robustly in the accumulation of noncoding DNA so that the best individual leaves one offspring without mutation (or only neutral ones) per generation.},

	Abstract = {The phenotypic effects of random mutations depend on both the architecture of the genome and the gene-trait relationships. Both levels thus play a key role in the mutational variability of the phenotype, and hence in the long-term evolutionary success of the lineage. Here, by simulating the evolution of organisms with flexible genomes, we show that the need for an appropriate phenotypic variability induces a relationship between the deleteriousness of gene mutations and the quantity of non-coding sequences maintained in the genome. The more deleterious the gene mutations, the shorter the intergenic sequences. Indeed, in a shorter genome, fewer genes are affected by rearrangements (duplications, deletions, inversions, translocations) at each replication, which compensates for the higher impact of each gene mutation. This spontaneous adjustment of genome structure allows the organisms to retain the same average fitness loss per replication, despite the higher impact of single gene mutations. These results show how evolution can generate unexpected couplings between distinct organization levels.},

	Abstract = {Evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations that often surprise the scientists who discover them. However, the creativity of evolution is not limited to the natural world: Artificial organisms evolving in computational environments have also elicited surprise and wonder from the researchers studying them. The process of evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution can provide examples of how their evolving algorithms and organisms have creatively subverted their expectations or intentions, exposed unrecognized bugs in their code, produced unexpectedly adaptations, or engaged in behaviors and outcomes, uncannily convergent with ones found in nature. Such stories routinely reveal surprise and creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. Bugs are fixed, experiments are refocused, and one-off surprises are collapsed into a single data point. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This article is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases.

@article{Mo21,
	Abstract = {Negative genetic regulators of phenotypic heterogeneity, or phenotypic capacitors/stabilizers, elevate population average fitness by limiting deviation from the optimal phenotype and increase the efficacy of natural selection by enhancing the phenotypic differences among genotypes. Stabilizers can presumably be switched off to release phenotypic heterogeneity in the face of extreme or fluctuating environments to ensure population survival. This task could, however, also be achieved by positive genetic regulators of phenotypic heterogeneity, or ``phenotypic diversifiers,''as shown by recently reported evidence that a bacterial divisome factor enhances antibiotic resistance. We hypothesized that such active creation of phenotypic heterogeneity by diversifiers, which is functionally independent of stabilizers, is more common than previously recognized. Using morphological phenotypic data from 4,718 single-gene knockout strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we systematically identified 324 stabilizers and 160 diversifiers and constructed a bipartite network between these genes and the morphological traits they control. Further analyses showed that, compared with stabilizers, diversifiers tended to be weaker and more promiscuous (regulating more traits) regulators targeting traits unrelated to fitness. Moreover, there is a general division of labor between stabilizers and diversifiers. Finally, by incorporating NCI-60 human cancer cell line anticancer drug screening data, we found that human one-to-one orthologs of yeast diversifiers/stabilizers likely regulate the anticancer drug resistance of human cancer cell lines, suggesting that these orthologs are potential targets for auxiliary treatments. Our study therefore highlights stabilizers and diversifiers as the genetic regulators for the bidirectional control of phenotypic heterogeneity as well as their distinct evolutionary roles and functional independence.},

	Abstract = {Microbes transiently differentiate into distinct, specialized cell types to generate functional diversity and cope with changing environmental conditions. Though alternate programs often entail radically different physiological and morphological states, recent single-cell studies have revealed that these crucial decisions are often left to chance. In these cases, the underlying genetic circuits leverage the intrinsic stochasticity of intracellular chemistry to drive transition between states. Understanding how these circuits transform transient gene expression fluctuations into lasting phenotypic programs will require a combination of quantitative modeling and extensive, time-resolved observation of switching events in single cells. In this article, we survey microbial cell fate decisions demonstrated to involve a random element, describe theoretical frameworks for understanding stochastic switching between states, and highlight recent advances in microfluidics that will enable characterization of key dynamic features of these circuits.},

	Abstract = {The phenotype of an individual microbial cell is not determined by genes and environment alone. Rather, a number of cellular mechanisms produce phenotypic differences between genetically identical cells grown in homogeneous environments; these differences are referred to as phenotypic heterogeneity.The degree of heterogeneity that arises in a given trait is influenced by the biochemical properties of molecules and by the architecture of gene-regulatory networks. Mutations and other genetic changes can therefore influence the degree of phenotypic heterogeneity.As a consequence, phenotypic heterogeneity is an evolvable trait that can be shaped by natural selection. Increased levels of heterogeneity in specific phenotypic traits can evolve if this provides organisms with benefits in terms of increased survival and growth.One possible benefit is that phenotypic heterogeneity can help organisms to cope with fluctuating environments. This effect is known as bet hedging.Another possible benefit arises through division of labour. Individual cells with different phenotypic traits can specialize in different activities and behaviours and can engage in beneficial interactions.Phenotypic heterogeneity is a potentially important component of biological diversity; it arises at the level of individual microbial cells and provides groups of microorganisms with added functionality.},

However, few textbooks or monographs take the effort of placing the equation within its right historical context and discuss the assumptions that have gone into its institution. This guide will dwell on these in substantial detail. Further, this guide will attempt to instil a sense of appreciation for the mathematical curve rectangular hyperbola, its unique attributes and how ubiquitous the curve is in biological systems. To conclude, this guide will discuss the limitations of the equation, and the method it embodies, and trace the journey of how investigators are attempting to move beyond the steady-state approach and the Michaelis?Menten equation into full progress curve, pre?steady state and single-turnover kinetic analysis to obtain greater insights into enzyme kinetics and catalysis.},

However, examination of a historical case --Maxime Lamotte's study of natural populations of the land snail, Cepaea nemoralis in the 1950s --shows that while some pessimism is warranted, it has been overstated. Indeed, by describing a unique signature for drift and showing that this signature obtained in the populations under study, Lamotte was able to make a good case for a significant role for␣drift. It may be difficult to disentangle the causes of drift and selection acting in a population, but it is not (always) impossible.},

@article{Hammerstein96,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of how to conceive a robust theory of phenotypic adaptation in non-trivial models of evolutionary biology. A particular effort is made to develop a foundation of this theory in the context of n-locus population genetics. Therefore, the evolution of phenotypic traits is considered that are coded for by more than one gene. The potential for epistatic gene interactions is not a priori excluded. Furthermore, emphasis is laid on the intricacies of frequency-dependent selection. It is first discussed how strongly the scope for phenotypic adaptation is restricted by the complex nature of 'reproduction mechanics' in sexually reproducing diploid populations. This discussion shows that one can easily lose the traces of Darwinism in n-locus models of population genetics. In order to retrieve these traces, the outline of a new theory is given that I call 'streetcar theory of evolution'. This theory is based on the same models that geneticists have used in order to demonstrate substantial problems with the 'adaptationist programme'. However, these models are now analyzed differently by including thoughts about the evolutionary removal of genetic constraints. This requires consideration of a sufficiently wide range of potential mutant alleles and careful examination of what to consider as a stable state of the evolutionary process. A particular notion of stability is introduced in order to describe population states that are phenotypically stable against the effects of all mutant alleles that are to be expected in the long-run. Surprisingly, a long-term stable state can be characterized at the phenotypic level as a fitness maximum, a Nash equilibrium or an ESS. The paper presents these mathematical results and discusses - at unusual length for a mathematical journal - their fundamental role in our current understanding of evolution.},

@article{Orzack05,
	Abstract = {Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) models are widely viewed as predicting the strategy of an individual that when monomorphic or nearly so prevents a mutant with any other strategy from entering the population. In fact, the prediction of some of these models is ambiguous when the predicted strategy is "mixed", as in the case of a sex ratio, which may be regarded as a mixture of the subtraits "produce a daughter" and "produce a son." Some models predict only that such a mixture be manifested by the population as a whole, that is, as an "evolutionarily stable state"; consequently, strategy monomorphism or polymorphism is consistent with the prediction. The hawk-dove game and the sex-ratio game in a panmictic population are models that make such a "degenerate" prediction. We show here that the incorporation of population finiteness into degenerate models has effects for and against the evolution of a monomorphism (an ESS) that are of equal order in the population size, so that no one effect can be said to predominate. Therefore, we used Monte Carlo simulations to determine the probability that a finite population evolves to an ESS as opposed to a polymorphism. We show that the probability that an ESS will evolve is generally much less than has been reported and that this probability depends on the population size, the type of competition among individuals, and the number of and distribution of strategies in the initial population. We also demonstrate how the strength of natural selection on strategies can increase as population size decreases. This inverse dependency underscores the incorrectness of Fisher's and Wright's assumption that there is just one qualitative relationship between population size and the intensity of natural selection.},

Commonly used criteria for adaptation in either sense have limited applicability. There are, however, a number of widely applicable criteria for adaptation per se, such as several kinds of cost, low variation, the maintenance of integration, and the fitness distribution of mutations. Application of these criteria leads to the conclusion that adaptation is overwhelmingly prevalent for features of organisms. Neither the presence nor the absence of adaptation has a privileged status in inference. Effectively neutral evolution can occur on adaptive buttes while maintaining the same degree of adaptation, but it is likely to be relatively minor.},

This narrow view of evolution has become untenable in light of recent observations from genomic sequencing and population-genetic theory. Numerous aspects of genomic architecture, gene structure, and developmental pathways are difficult to explain without invoking the nonadaptive forces of genetic drift and mutation. In addition, emergent biological features such as complexity, modularity, and evolvability, all of which are current targets of considerable speculation, may be nothing more than indirect by-products of processes operating at lower levels of organization. These issues are examined in the context of the view that the origins of many aspects of biological diversity, from gene-structural embellishments to novelties at the phenotypic level, have roots in nonadaptive processes, with the population-genetic environment imposing strong directionality on the paths that are open to evolutionary exploitation.},

@article{Sansom03,
	Abstract = {This contribution to the adaptationism debate elaborates the nature of constraints and their importance in evolutionary explanation and argues that the adaptationism debate should be limited to the issue of how to privilege causes in evolutionary explanation. I argue that adaptationist explanations are deeply conceptually dependent on developmental constraints, and explanations that appeal to constraints are dependant on the results of natural selection. I suggest these explanations should be integrated into the framework of historical causal explanation. Each strategy explicitly appeals to some aspect of the evolutionary process, while implicitly appealing to others. Thus, adaptationists and anti-adaptationists can offer complementary causal explanations of the same explanandum. This eliminates much of the adaptationism debate and explains why its adversaries regularly agree with each other more than they would like. The adaptationism issue that remains is a species of the general issue of how to privilege causes in explanation. I show how a proposed solution to this general problem might be brought to bear on evolutionary explanations, and investigate some difficulties that might arise due to the nature of the evolutionary process.},

	Abstract = {Debate about adaptationism in biology continues, in part because within ``the''problem of assessing adaptationism, three distinct problems are mixed together. The three problems concern the assessment of three distinct adaptationist positions, each of which asserts the central importance of adaptation and natural selection to the study of evolution but conceives this importance in a different way. As there are three kinds of adaptationism, there are three distinct ``antiadaptationist''positions as well. Or putting it more formally, there are three different dimensions here, and strongly adaptationist views, strongly antiadaptationist views, and moderate views are possible for each dimension.Understanding the distinctions between the three adaptationist positions will not remove all controversy, but some progress can be made through clarifying the distinctions. In particular, progress can be made by recognizing that evidence against one kind of adaptationism need not also be evidence against other kinds. So the main aims of this chapter are classification and clarification. I describe the three kinds of adaptationism and then discuss the evidence relevant to each one. In particular, I try to say which problems might be solved directly through empirical research, and which are more philosophical in character.A STATEMENT OF THE DISTINCTIONSHere are the three kinds of adaptationism I recognize: empirical adaptationism, explanatory adaptationism, and methodological adaptationism.Empirical Adaptationism: Natural selection is a powerful and ubiquitous force, and there are few constraints, except general and obvious ones, on the biological variation that fuels it. To a large degree, it is possible to predict and explain the outcome of evolutionary processes by attending only to the role played by selection. No other evolutionary factor has this degree of causal importance.},

	N2 = {Abstract Trade-offs are a core component of many evolutionary models, particularly those dealing with the evolution of life histories. In the present paper, we identify four topics of key importance for studies of the evolutionary biology of trade-offs. First, we consider the underlying concept of ?constraint?. We conclude that this term is typically used too vaguely and suggest that ?constraint? in the sense of a bias should be clearly distinguished from ?constraint? in the sense of proscribed combinations of traits or evolutionary trajectories. Secondly, we address the utility of the acquisition?allocation model (the ?Y-model?). We find that, whereas this model and its derivatives have provided new insights, a misunderstanding of the pivotal equation has led to incorrect predictions and faulty tests. Thirdly, we ask how trade-offs are expected to evolve under directional selection. A quantitative genetic model predicts that, under weak or short-term selection, the intercept will change but the slope will remain constant. Two empirical tests support this prediction but these are based on comparisons of geographic populations: more direct tests will come from artificial selection experiments. Finally, we discuss what maintains variation in trade-offs noting that at present little attention has been given to this question. We distinguish between phenotypic and genetic variation and suggest that the latter is most in need of explanation. We suggest that four factors deserving investigation are mutation-selection balance, antagonistic pleiotropy, correlational selection and spatio-temporal variation, but as in the other areas of research on trade-offs, empirical generalizations are impeded by lack of data. Although this lack is discouraging, we suggest that it provides a rich ground for further study and the integration of many disciplines, including the emerging field of genomics.},

@article{Lynch86,
	Abstract = {{$[$}A general model is developed for predicting the genetic variance within populations and the rate of divergence of population mean phenotypes for quantitative traits under the joint operation of random sampling drift and mutation in the absence of selection. In addition to incorporating the dominance effects of mutant alleles, the model yields some insight into the effects of linkage and the mating system on the mutational production of quantitative-genetic variation. Despite these additional and potentially serious complications, it is found that, for small populations, the simple predictions obtained by previous investigators using additive-genetic models hold reasonably well. Even after accounting for dominance and linkage, the equilibrium level of genetic variance is unlikely to be much less than 2NVm or to be more than 4NVm, where N is the effective population size and Vm is the new variance from mutation appearing each generation. The rate of increase of the between-line variance per generation ultimately equals 2Vm regardless of population size, although the time to attain the asymptotic rate is proportional to N. Expressions are presented for the rate of approach to the equilibrium level of genetic variance and for the expected variance of the within-population and between-population genetic variances. The relevance of the derived model, which amounts to a generalization of the neutral theory to the phenotypic level, is discussed in the context of the detection of natural selection, the maintenance of pure lines for biomedical and agricultural purposes, the development of genetic conservation programs, and the design of indices of morphological distance between species.{$]$}},

These include the log-normal distribution of abundance, the relation between range and abundance, the species-area law, and the turnover of species composition. Each pattern is the subject of a large literature that interprets it in terms of ecological processes, typically involving the sorting of differently specialized species onto heterogeneous landscapes. All of these patterns can be shown to arise, however, from neutral community models in which all individuals have identical properties, as the consequence of local dispersal alone. This implies, at the least, that functional interpretations of these patterns must be reevaluated. More fundamentally, neutral community models provide a general theory for biodiversity and conservation biology capable of predicting the fundamental processes and patterns of community ecology.},

	N2 = {Ecologists have long agreed that to coexist species must be sufficiently different (1, 2). This worldview was challenged when Stephen Hubbell published his neutral theory of biodiversity showing that species that are essentially equal should also be able to evade competitive exclusion (3). Although this neutral theory inspired a fresh look at biodiversity, it also met resistance as it seemed to violate the deeply held belief that all species are fundamentally different. Interestingly, a harmonious combination of niche differentiation and neutrality can emerge naturally in simulated communities, thus suggesting a way of unifying the niche and neutral view (4). A peculiar prediction of this theory of emergent neutrality is that species should be distributed over niche space in a lumpy way, a pattern that is indeed often observed in nature (5⇓⇓⇓--9). In this view the lumps correspond to niches, while species within lumps are essentially more of the same, reflecting two alternative ways for species to coexist: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar (Fig. 1). A study in PNAS now lends important support to this unifying theory by showing its compatibility with Tilman's widely embraced theory of competition for resources (10).Fig. 1. Simulation of the evolutionary adaptation of species showing the emergence of regularly spaced lumps of near-neutral coexistence. Species move away from the gaps toward the self-organized niches reflected in the lumps. The distance between the lumps corresponds to the niche separation that is theoretically predicted from the classic theory of limiting similarity. Modified with permission from ref. 4; Copyright (2006), National Academy of Sciences, USA.The theoretical prediction that coexistence of two species requires sufficient niche differentiation (2) has become one of the cornerstones of ecology. It also makes intuitive sense. The smaller the niche overlap, the weaker the competition {\ldots}↵1To whom correspondence should be addressed. Email: Marten.Scheffer{\{}at{\}}wur.nl.},

	Abstract = {Understanding how genotypes map onto phenotypes, fitness, and eventually organisms is arguably the next major missing piece in a fully predictive theory of evolution. We refer to this generally as the problem of the genotype-phenotype map. Though we are still far from achieving a complete picture of these relationships, our current understanding of simpler questions, such as the structure induced in the space of genotypes by sequences mapped to molecular structures, has revealed important facts that deeply affect the dynamical description of evolutionary processes. Empirical evidence supporting the fundamental relevance of features such as phenotypic bias is mounting as well, while the synthesis of conceptual and experimental progress leads to questioning current assumptions on the nature of evolutionary dynamics---cancer progression models or synthetic biology approaches being notable examples. This work delves with a critical and constructive attitude into our current knowledge of how genotypes map onto molecular phenotypes and organismal functions, and discusses theoretical and empirical avenues to broaden and improve this comprehension. As a final goal, this community should aim at deriving an updated picture of evolutionary processes soundly relying on the structural properties of genotype spaces, as revealed by modern techniques of molecular and functional analysis.},

	N2 = {ABSTRACT Variation in DNA content has been largely ignored as a factor in evolution, particularly following the advent of sequence-based approaches to genomic analysis. The significant genome size diversity among organisms (more than 200000-fold among eukaryotes) bears no relationship to organismal complexity and both the origins and reasons for the clearly non-random distribution of this variation remain unclear. Several theories have been proposed to explain this ?C-value enigma? (heretofore known as the ?C-value paradox?), each of which can be described as either a ?mutation pressure? or ?optimal DNA? theory. Mutation pressure theories consider the large portion of non-coding DNA in eukaryotic genomes as either ?junk? or ?selfish? DNA and are important primarily in considerations of the origin of secondary DNA. Optimal DNA theories differ from mutation pressure theories by emphasizing the strong link between DNA content and cell and nuclear volumes. While mutation pressure theories generally explain this association with cell size as coincidental, the nucleoskeletal theory proposes a coevolutionary interaction between nuclear and cell volume, with DNA content adjusted adaptively following shifts in cell size. Each of these approaches to the C-value enigma is problematic for a variety of reasons and the preponderance of the available evidence instead favours the nucleotypic theory which postulates a causal link between bulk DNA amount and cell volume. Under this view, variation in DNA content is under direct selection via its impacts on cellular and organismal parameters. Until now, no satisfactory mechanism has been presented to explain this nucleotypic effect. However, recent advances in the study of cell cycle regulation suggest a possible ?gene-nucleus interaction model? which may account for it. The present article provides a detailed review of the debate surrounding the C-value enigma, the various theories proposed to explain it, and the evidence in favour of a causal connection between DNA content and cell size. In addition, a new model of nucleotypic influence is developed, along with suggestions for further empirical investigation. Finally, some evolutionary implications of genome size diversity are considered, and a broadening of the traditional ?biological hierarchy? is recommended.},

Partly this reflects the fact that the word 'fitness' has been used to mean subtly different things. In this Review I distinguish among these meanings (for example, individual fitness, absolute fitness and relative fitness) and explain how evolutionary geneticists use fitness to predict changes in the genetic composition of populations through time. I also review the empirical study of fitness, emphasizing approaches that take advantage of recent genetic and genomic data, and I highlight important unresolved problems in understanding fitness.},

@article{Sibly02,
	Abstract = {We argue that population growth rate is the key unifying variable linking the various facets of population ecology. The importance of population growth rate lies partly in its central role in forecasting future population trends; indeed if the form of density dependence were constant and known, then the future population dynamics could to some degree be predicted. We argue that population growth rate is also central to our understanding of environmental stress: environmental stressors should be defined as factors which when first applied to a population reduce population growth rate. The joint action of such stressors determines an organism's ecological niche, which should be defined as the set of environmental conditions where population growth rate is greater than zero (where population growth rate = r = log(e)(N(t+1)/N(t))). While environmental stressors have negative effects on population growth rate, the same is true of population density, the case of negative linear effects corresponding to the well-known logistic equation. Following Sinclair, we recognize population regulation as occurring when population growth rate is negatively density dependent. Surprisingly, given its fundamental importance in population ecology, only 25 studies were discovered in the literature in which population growth rate has been plotted against population density. In 12 of these the effects of density were linear; in all but two of the remainder the relationship was concave viewed from above. Alternative approaches to establishing the determinants of population growth rate are reviewed, paying special attention to the demographic and mechanistic approaches. The effects of population density on population growth rate may act through their effects on food availability and associated effects on somatic growth, fecundity and survival, according to a 'numerical response', the evidence for which is briefly reviewed. Alternatively, there may be effects on population growth rate of population density in addition to those that arise through the partitioning of food between competitors; this is 'interference competition'. The distinction is illustrated using a replicated laboratory experiment on a marine copepod, Tisbe battagliae. Application of these approaches in conservation biology, ecotoxicology and human demography is briefly considered. We conclude that population regulation, density dependence, resource and interference competition, the effects of environmental stress and the form of the ecological niche, are all best defined and analysed in terms of population growth rate.},

	Abstract = {Heisenberg's uncertainty principle was originally posed for the limit of the accuracy of simultaneous measurement of non-commuting observables as stating that canonically conjugate observables can be measured simultaneously only with the constraint that the product of their mean errors should be no less than a limit set by Planck's constant. However, Heisenberg with the subsequent completion by Kennard has long been credited only with a constraint for state preparation represented by the product of the standard deviations. Here, we show that Heisenberg actually proved the constraint for the accuracy of simultaneous measurement, but assuming an obsolete postulate for quantum mechanics. This assumption, known as the repeatability hypothesis, formulated explicitly by von Neumann and Schr\&{\#}xf6;dinger, was broadly accepted until the 1970s, but abandoned in the 1980s, when completely general quantum measurement theory was established. We also survey the present author's recent proposal for a universally valid reformulation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle under the most general assumption on quantum measurement.},

	N2 = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a population should persist without immigration from external sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

@article{Meijer20,
	Abstract = {Metabolic exchange is widespread in natural microbial communities and an important driver of ecosystem structure and diversity, yet it remains unclear what determines whether microbes evolve division of labor or maintain metabolic autonomy. Here we use a mechanistic model to study how metabolic strategies evolve in a constant, one resource environment, when metabolic networks are allowed to freely evolve. We find that initially identical ancestral communities of digital organisms follow different evolutionary trajectories, as some communities become dominated by a single, autonomous lineage, while others are formed by stably coexisting lineages that cross-feed on essential building blocks. Our results show how without presupposed cellular trade-offs or external drivers such as temporal niches, diverse metabolic strategies spontaneously emerge from the interplay between ecology, spatial structure, and metabolic constraints that arise during the evolution of metabolic networks. Thus, in the long term, whether microbes remain autonomous or evolve metabolic division of labour is an evolutionary contingency.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary biology is undergirded by an extensive and impressive set of mathematical models. Yet only one result, Fisher's theorem about selection and fitness, is generally accorded the status of a fundamental theorem. I argue that although its fundamental status is justified by its simplicity and scope, there are additional results that seem similarly fundamental. I suggest that the most fundamental theorem of evolution is the Price equation, both because of its simplicity and broad scope and because it can be used to derive four other familiar results that are similarly fundamental: Fisher's average-excess equation, Robertson's secondary theorem of natural selection, the breeder's equation, and Fisher's fundamental theorem. These derivations clarify both the relationships behind these results and their assumptions. Slightly less fundamental results include those for multivariate evolution and social selection. A key feature of fundamental theorems is that they have great simplicity and scope, which are often achieved by sacrificing perfect accuracy. Quantitative genetics has been more productive of fundamental theorems than population genetics, probably because its empirical focus on unknown genotypes freed it from the tyranny of detail and allowed it to focus on general issues.},

@article{Wagner10,
	Abstract = {In this article, an approach to measure fitness is proposed that considers fitness as a measure of competitive ability among phenotypes or genotypes. This approach is based on pairwise competition tests and is related to measures of "utility" in mathematical economics. Extending the results from utility theory it is possible to recover the classical Wrightian fitness measure without reference to models of population growth. A condition, quasi-BTL, similar to the Bradley-Terry-Luce condition of classical utility theory is shown to be necessary for the existence of frequency and context-independent fitness measures. Testing for violations of this quasi-BTL condition can be used to the detect genotype-by-genotype interactions and frequency-dependent fitness. A method for the detection of genotype by environment interactions is proposed that avoids potential scaling artifacts. Furthermore the measurement theoretical approach allows one to derive Wright's selection equation. This shows that classical selection equations are entirely general and exact. It is concluded that measurement theory is able to give definite answers to a number theoretical and practical questions. For instance, this theory identifies the correct scale for measuring gene interaction with respect to fitness and shows that different scales may lead to wrong conclusions.},

	Abstract = {The question of the primordial ancestor must be approached through the search for the origin of evolution, not through the search for the origin of life. There is a major issue with the concept of life because it is impossible to define, thus is not a scientific but a metaphysical concept. On the contrary, evolution may be defined by as few as three conditions. These do not necessarily involve biopolymers. However, such an approach must give clues to explain the emergence of distinct lineages to allow Darwinian natural selection. A plausible solution exists within an autotrophic lipidic vesicle-based model that is presented. The model requires the existence of hydrothermal sites such as the Lost City Hydrothermal Field leading to specific constraints. For this reason Mars and Europa may be questioned as possible cradles of evolution. If we replace the search for the origin of life by the one for the origin of evolution our priority first is to find a consensus on the minimal conditions that would allow evolution to emerge and persist anywhere in the universe.},

It is indeed impossible to define a ``natural''frontier between non-living and living systems and therefore also impossible to define dichotomic criteria which could be used in order to classify systems in one of these two classes (living or non-living). Fuzzy logic provides a natural way to deal with problems where class membership lacks sharply defined criteria. It also offers the possibility to avoid losing time with unnecessary controversies such as deciding whether a virus is, or is not, a living system.},

This situation is rapidly changing, following several discoveries that have modified our vision of viruses. It has been recognized that viruses have played (and still play) a major innovative role in the evolution of cellular organisms. New definitions of viruses have been proposed and their position in the universal tree of life is actively discussed. Viruses are no more confused with their virions, but can be viewed as complex living entities that transform the infected cell into a novel organism---the virus---producing virions. I suggest here to define life (an historical process) as the mode of existence of ribosome encoding organisms (cells) and capsid encoding organisms (viruses) and their ancestors. I propose to define an organism as an ensemble of integrated organs (molecular or cellular) producing individuals evolving through natural selection. The origin of life on our planet would correspond to the establishment of the first organism corresponding to this definition.},

	Abstract = {Erwin Schr{\"o}dinger defined life not only as a ``self-reproducing''aperiodic crystal of DNA coding for proteins but within the context of living entities increasing their order by dissipating matter/energy gradients to maintain themselves away from equilibirium. Since then most definitions of life have focused on the former. But living cells do more than replicate their DNA. Cells also have membrane barriers across which metabolites must move, via which energy transduction as well as information processing occurs, and within which metabolic transformation occurs. An approach of complex systems dynamics, including nonequilibrium thermodynamics, may provide a more robust approach for defining life than a ``naked replicator''at the origin of life. The crucial issue becomes the process of emergence of life from pre-biotic chemistry, concomitant with the emergence of function, information, and semiosis. Living entities can be viewed as bounded, informed autocatalytic cycles feeding off matter/energy gradients, exhibiting agency, capable of growth, reproduction, and evolution. Understanding how life might have emerged should sharpen our definition of what life is.},

	Abstract = {A new definition of life is proposed and discussed in the present article. It is formulated by modifying and extending NASA's working definition of life, which postulates that life is a "self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution". The new definition includes a thermodynamical aspect of life as a far from equilibrium system and considers the flow of information from the environment to the living system. In our derivation of the definition of life we have assumed the hypothesis, that during the emergence of life evolution had to first involve autocatalytic systems that only subsequently acquired the capacity of genetic heredity. The new proposed definition of life is independent of the mode of evolution, regardless of whether Lamarckian or Darwinian evolution operated at the origins of life and throughout evolutionary history. The new definition of life presented herein is formulated in a minimal manner and it is general enough that it does not distinguish between individual (metabolic) network and the collective (ecological) one. The newly proposed definition of life may be of interest for astrobiology, research into the origins of life or for efforts to produce synthetic or artificial life, and it furthermore may also have implications in the cognitive and computer sciences.},

	Abstract = {Mach's Principle is taken as a criterion for selecting cosmological solutions of the Einstein field equations, in which, in a well-defined manner, the metric arises from material sources alone. In such model universes inertial forces are due to the gravitational interaction of matter, and there is a relativity of accelerated motion. The problem of stating such a selection rule in general relativity divides into two parts: an analysis of the relation of the metric to the Riemann curvature, and of the curvature to the stress tensor, with associated Machian criteria. From the first criterion we show that Mach's Principle is not satisfied in Minkowski space. It seems that asymptotically fiat space-times are also non-Machian, as required by the Machian philosophy. The second criterion rules out vacuum solutions and spatially homogeneous cosmological models containing perfect fluids in which there is anisotropic expansion or rotation. Mach's Principle is found to be satisfied in Robertson--Walker models and in a simple class of inhomogeneous solutions. These results lead us to suggest that Mach's Principle may play a role in explaining the observed gross features of the Universe.},

@article{Rafiqi20,
	Abstract = {Obligate endosymbiosis, in which distantly related species integrate to form a single replicating individual, represents a major evolutionary transition in individuality1--3. Although such transitions are thought to increase biological complexity1,2,4--6, the evolutionary and developmental steps that lead to integration remain poorly understood. Here we show that obligate endosymbiosis between the bacteria Blochmannia and the hyperdiverse ant tribe Camponotini7--11 originated and also elaborated through radical alterations in embryonic development, as compared to other insects. The Hox genes Abdominal A (abdA) and Ultrabithorax (Ubx)---which, in arthropods, normally function to differentiate abdominal and thoracic segments after they form---were rewired to also regulate germline genes early in development. Consequently, the mRNAs and proteins of these Hox genes are expressed maternally and colocalize at a subcellular level with those of germline genes in the germplasm and three novel locations in the freshly laid egg. Blochmannia bacteria then selectively regulate these mRNAs and proteins to make each of these four locations functionally distinct, creating a system of coordinates in the embryo in which each location performs a different function to integrate Blochmannia into the Camponotini. Finally, we show that the capacity to localize mRNAs and proteins to new locations in the embryo evolved before obligate endosymbiosis and was subsequently co-opted by Blochmannia and Camponotini. This pre-existing molecular capacity converged with a pre-existing ecological mutualism12,13 to facilitate both the horizontal transfer10 and developmental integration of Blochmannia into Camponotini. Therefore, the convergence of pre-existing molecular capacities and ecological interactions---as well as the rewiring of highly conserved gene networks---may be a general feature that facilitates the origin and elaboration of major transitions in individuality.},

	N2 = {Abstract The so-called size-complexity rule claims the existence of a positive correlation between organism size and number of cell types. In this spirit, here we address the relationship between organism size and number of potential tasks that can be performed. The modeling relies on the assumption that the states of the cells within the aggregates are such that the maximum fitness is realized, but also relies on the existence of tradeoffs among the distinct functions. For group sizes larger than the number of potential tasks, fitness maximization is attained when all cells in group specialize in a given task. Under this scenario, the number of potential tasks equals the number of cell types. We have found that the morphology and the topology of aggregates, as well as the developmental mode, strongly influence the dynamics of body formation. Particularly, it has been observed that more compact structures, such as sphere-like structures, are more likely to follow the claim of the size-complexity rule, whereas more fragile structures such as linear chains, which are more vulnerable to drastic changes due to division mechanisms, can, in a broad scenario, violate the size-complexity rule.},

	Abstract = {Through a mechanistic approach we investigate the formation of aggregates of variable sizes, accounting mechanisms of aggregation, dissociation, death and reproduction. In our model, cells can produce two metabolites, but the simultaneous production of both metabolites is costly in terms of fitness. Thus, the formation of larger groups can favor the aggregates to evolve to a configuration where division of labor arises. It is assumed that the states of the cells in a group are those that maximize organismal fitness. In the model it is considered that the groups can grow linearly, forming a chain, or compactly keeping a roughly spherical shape. Starting from a population consisting of single-celled organisms, we observe the formation of groups with variable sizes and usually much larger than two-cell aggregates.

	Abstract = {The evolutionary transition towards multicellular life often involves growth in groups of undifferentiated cells followed by differentiation into soma and germ-like cells. Theory predicts that germ soma differentiation is facilitated by a convex trade-off between survival and reproduction. However, this has never been tested and these transitions remain poorly understood at the ecological and genetic level. Here, we study the evolution of cell groups in ten isogenic lines of the unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with prolonged exposure to a rotifer predator. We confirm that growth in cell groups is heritable and characterized by a convex trade-off curve between reproduction and survival. Identical mutations evolve in all cell group isolates; these are linked to survival and reducing associated cell costs. Overall, we show that just 500 generations of predator selection were sufficient to lead to a convex trade-off and incorporate evolved changes into the prey genome.},

	Abstract = {Several attempts have already been made to interpret the well-established results of biometry in accordance with the Mendelian scheme of inheritance. It is here attempted to ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations σ1 and σ2, it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of the total variance which they together produce. It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the ``percentage of causation,''which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided.},

They were the first organisms to evolve oxygenic photosynthesis, and so changed the Earth's atmosphere from anoxic to oxic. As a consequence, many nitrogen-fixing bacteria became confined to suitable anoxic environmental niches, because the enzyme nitrogenase is highly sensitive to oxygen. However, in the cyanobacteria a number of strategies evolved that protected nitrogenase from oxygen, including a temporal separation of oxygenic photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation and, in some filamentous strains, the differentiation of a specialized cell, the heterocyst, which provided a suitable microaerobic environment for the functioning of nitrogenase. The evolution of a spore-like cell, the akinete, almost certainly preceded that of the heterocyst and, indeed, the akinete may have been the ancestor of the heterocyst. Cyanobacteria have the capacity to differentiate several additional cell and filament types, but this review will concentrate on the heterocyst and the akinete, emphasizing the differentiation and spacing of these specialized cells.},

	Abstract = {The transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms is one of the most significant events in the history of life. Key to this process is the emergence of Darwinian individuality at the higher level: Groups must become single entities capable of reproduction for selection to shape their evolution. Evolutionary transitions in individuality are characterized by cooperation between the lower level entities and by division of labor. Theory suggests that division of labor may drive the transition to multicellularity by eliminating the trade off between two incompatible processes that cannot be performed simultaneously in one cell. Here, we examine the evolution of the most ancient multicellular transition known today, that of cyanobacteria, where we reconstruct the sequence of ecological and phenotypic trait evolution. Our results show that the prime driver of multicellularity in cyanobacteria was the expansion in metabolic capacity offered by nitrogen fixation, which was accompanied by the emergence of the filamentous morphology and succeeded by a reproductive life cycle. This was followed by the progression of multicellularity into higher complexity in the form of differentiated cells and patterned multicellularity.},

	N2 = {Reproductive division of labor has been proposed to play a key role for evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs). This chapter provides a guide to a theoretical model that addresses the role of a tradeoff between life-history traits in selecting for a reproductive division of labor during the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms. In particular, it focuses on the five keys assumptions of the model, namely (1) fitness is viability times fecundity; (2) collective traits are linear functions of their cellular counterparts; (3) there is a tradeoff between cell viability and fecundity; (4) cell contribution to the collective is optimal; and (5) there is an initial reproductive cost in large collectives. Thereafter the chapter contrasts two interpretations of the model in the context of ETIs. Originally, the model was interpreted as showing that during the transition to multicellularity the fitness of the lower-level (the cells) is ``transferred''to the higher level (the collective). Despite its apparent intuitiveness, fitness transfer may obscure actual mechanisms in metaphorical language. Thus, an alternative and more conservative interpretation of the model that focuses on cell traits and the evolutionary constraints that links them is advocated. In addition, it allows for pursuing subsequent questions, such as the evolution of development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

These transitions have been characterized by individuals that could previously replicate independently, cooperating to form a new, more complex life form. For example, archaea and eubacteria formed eukaryotic cells, and cells formed multicellular organisms. However, not all cooperative groups are en route to major transitions. How can we explain why major evolutionary transitions have or haven't taken place on different branches of the tree of life? We break down major transitions into two steps: the formation of a cooperative group and the transformation of that group into an integrated entity. We show how these steps require cooperation, division of labor, communication, mutual dependence, and negligible within-group conflict. We find that certain ecological conditions and the ways in which groups form have played recurrent roles in driving multiple transitions. In contrast, we find that other factors have played relatively minor roles at many key points, such as within-group kin discrimination and mechanisms to actively repress competition. More generally, by identifying the small number of factors that have driven major transitions, we provide a simpler and more unified description of how life on earth has evolved.},

Well-known examples include the evolution of specialized enzymes after gene duplication, the evolution of specialized cell types, limb diversification in arthropods, and the evolution of specialized colony members in many taxa of marine invertebrates and social insects. Here, we identify conditions favoring the evolution of division of labor by means of a general mathematical model. Our starting point is the assumption that modules contribute to two different biological tasks and that the potential of modules to contribute to these tasks is traded off. Our results are phrased in terms of properties of performance functions that map the phenotype of modules to measures of performance. We show that division of labor is favored by three factors: positional effects that predispose modules for one of the tasks, accelerating performance functions, and synergistic interactions between modules. If modules can be lost or damaged, selection for robustness can counteract selection for functional specialization. To illustrate our theory we apply it to the evolution of specialized enzymes coded by duplicated genes.},

Significant advances include the concept of fraternal and egalitarian transitions (lower-level units like and unlike, respectively). Multilevel selection, first without, then with, the collectives in focus is an important explanatory mechanism. Transitions are decomposed into phases of origin, maintenance, and transformation (i.e., further evolution) of the higher level units, which helps reduce the number of transitions in the revised list by two so that it is less top-heavy. After the transition, units show strong cooperation and very limited realized conflict. The origins of cells, the emergence of the genetic code and translation, the evolution of the eukaryotic cell, multicellularity, and the origin of human groups with language are reconsidered in some detail in the light of new data and considerations. Arguments are given why sex is not in the revised list as a separate transition. Some of the transitions can be recursive (e.g., plastids, multicellularity) or limited (transitions that share the usual features of major transitions without a massive phylogenetic impact, such as the micro- and macronuclei in ciliates). During transitions, new units of reproduction emerge, and establishment of such units requires high fidelity of reproduction (as opposed to mere replication).},

Recently, several objections have been raised against traditional accounts of biological individuality, including the objections of monism (the tendency to focus on a single individuality criterion and/or a single biological field), theory-centrism (the tendency to discuss only theory-based individuation), ahistoricity (the tendency to neglect what biologists of the past and historians of biology have said about biological individuality), disciplinary isolationism (the tendency to isolate biological individuality from other scientific and philosophical domains that have investigated individuality), and the multiplication of conceptual uncertainties (the lack of a precise definition of ``biological individual''and related terms). In this introduction, I will examine the current philosophical landscape about biological individuality, and show how the contributions gathered in this special issue address these five objections. Overall, the aim of this issue is to offer a more diverse, unifying, and scientifically informed conception of what a biological individual is.},

Since these organisms are the main sources and sinks for N2O in the environment, their regulatory biology controls the emission of this potent greenhouse gas. We demonstrate bet hedging in Paracoccus denitrificans when facing hypoxia: a minority of the cells synthesize NIR + NOR, the N2O source, while all synthesize NOS, the N2O sink, hence the population becomes a strong net sink for N2O. Bet hedging is prominent below 20 $\,^{\circ}$C and data indicate that it is widespread in soil organisms. This suggests a prominent role of bet hedging in controlling N2O emissions that can now be tested for in other strains and in natural environments.When oxygen becomes limiting, denitrifying bacteria must prepare for anaerobic respiration by synthesizing the reductases NAR (NO3−→NO2−), NIR (NO2−→NO), NOR (2NO →N2O), and NOS (N2O →N2), either en bloc or sequentially, to avoid entrapment in anoxia without energy. Minimizing the metabolic burden of this precaution is a plausible fitness trait, and we show that the model denitrifier Paracoccus denitrificans achieves this by synthesizing NOS in all cells, while only a minority synthesize NIR. Phenotypic diversification with regards to NIR is ascribed to stochastic initiation of gene transcription, which becomes autocatalytic via NO production. Observed gas kinetics suggest that such bet hedging is widespread among denitrifying bacteria. Moreover, in response to oxygenation, P. denitrificans preserves NIR in the poles of nongrowing persister cells, ready to switch to anaerobic respiration in response to sudden anoxia. Our findings add dimensions to the regulatory biology of denitrification and identify regulatory traits that decrease N2O emissions.},

Here, we review recent exciting discoveries that point out different causes for metabolic heterogeneity within clonal microbial populations. These causes range from ecological factors and cell-inherent dynamics in constant environments to molecular noise in gene expression that propagates into metabolism.

@article{Cerulus16,
	Abstract = {Summary The fitness effect of biological noise remains unclear. For example, even within clonal microbial populations, individual cells grow at different speeds. Although it is known that the individuals' mean growth speed can affect population-level fitness, it is unclear how or whether growth speed heterogeneity itself is subject to natural selection. Here, we show that noisy single-cell division times can significantly affect population-level growth rate. Using time-lapse microscopy to measure the division times of thousands of individual S. cerevisiae cells across different genetic and environmental backgrounds, we find that the length of individual cells' division times can vary substantially between clonal individuals and that sublineages often show epigenetic inheritance of division times. By combining these experimental measurements with mathematical modeling, we find that, for a given mean division time, increasing heterogeneity and epigenetic inheritance of division times increases the population growth rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the heterogeneity and epigenetic inheritance of single-cell division times can be linked with variation in the expression of catabolic genes. Taken together, our results reveal how a change in noisy single-cell behaviors can directly influence fitness through dynamics that operate independently of effects caused by changes to the mean. These results not only allow a better understanding of microbial fitness but also help to more accurately predict fitness in other clonal populations, such as tumors.},

This developmental process is bistable, and only a subpopulation of cells actually differentiates into endospores. Why a cell decides to sporulate or not to do so is poorly understood. Here, through the use of time-lapse microscopy, we follow the growth, division, and differentiation of individual cells to identify elements of cell history and ancestry that could affect this decision process. These analyses show that during microcolony development, B. subtilis uses a bet-hedging strategy whereby some cells sporulate while others use alternative metabolites to continue growth, providing the latter subpopulation with a reproductive advantage. We demonstrate that B. subtilis is subject to aging. Nevertheless, the age of the cell plays no role in the decision of its fate. However, the physiological state of the cell's ancestor (more than two generations removed) does affect the outcome of cellular differentiation. We show that this epigenetic inheritance is based on positive feedback within the sporulation phosphorelay. The extended intergenerational ``memory''caused by this autostimulatory network may be important for the development of multicellular structures such as fruiting bodies and biofilms.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of multicellular animals (Metazoa) from their unicellular ancestors was a key transition that was accompanied by the emergence and diversification of gene families associated with multicellularity. To clarify the timing and order of specific events in this transition, we conducted expressed sequence tag surveys on 4 putative protistan relatives of Metazoa including the choanoflagellate Monosiga ovata, the ichthyosporeans Sphaeroforma arctica and Amoebidium parasiticum, and the amoeba Capsaspora owczarzaki, and 2 members of Amoebozoa, Acanthamoeba castellanii and Mastigamoeba balamuthi. We find that homologs of genes involved in metazoan multicellularity exist in several of these unicellular organisms, including 1 encoding a membrane-associated guanylate kinase with an inverted arrangement of protein-protein interaction domains (MAGI) in Capsaspora. In Metazoa, MAGI regulates tight junctions involved in cell-cell communication. By phylogenomic analyses of genes encoded in nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, we show that the choanoflagellates are the closest relatives of the Metazoa, followed by the Capsaspora and Ichthyosporea lineages, although the branching order between the latter 2 groups remains unclear. Understanding the function of "metazoan-specific" proteins we have identified in these protists will clarify the evolutionary steps that led to the emergence of the Metazoa.},

	Abstract = {The unicellular ancestor of animals had a complex repertoire of genes linked to multicellular processes. This suggests that changes in the regulatory genome, rather than in gene innovation, were key to the origin of animals. Here, we carry out multiple functional genomic assays in Capsaspora owczarzaki, the unicellular relative of animals with the largest known gene repertoire for transcriptional regulation. We show that changing chromatin states, differential lincRNA expression, and dynamic cis-regulatory sites are associated with life cycle transitions in Capsaspora. Moreover, we demonstrate conservation of animal developmental transcription-factor networks and extensive network interconnection in this premetazoan organism. In contrast, however, Capsaspora lacks animal promoter types, and its regulatory sites are small, proximal, and lack signatures of animal enhancers. Overall, our results indicate that the emergence of animal multicellularity was linked to a major shift in genome cis-regulatory complexity, most notably the appearance of distal enhancer regulation.},

@article{Tikhonenkov20,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The origin of animals from their unicellular ancestor was one of the most important events in evolutionary history, but the nature and the order of events leading up to the emergence of multicellular animals are still highly uncertain. The diversity and biology of unicellular relatives of animals have strongly informed our understanding of the transition from single-celled organisms to the multicellular Metazoa. Here, we analyze the cellular structures and complex life cycles of the novel unicellular holozoans Pigoraptor and Syssomonas (Opisthokonta), and their implications for the origin of animals. RESULTS: Syssomonas and Pigoraptor are characterized by complex life cycles with a variety of cell types including flagellates, amoeboflagellates, amoeboid non-flagellar cells, and spherical cysts. The life cycles also include the formation of multicellular aggregations and syncytium-like structures, and an unusual diet for single-celled opisthokonts (partial cell fusion and joint sucking of a large eukaryotic prey), all of which provide new insights into the origin of multicellularity in Metazoa. Several existing models explaining the origin of multicellular animals have been put forward, but these data are interestingly consistent with one, the "synzoospore hypothesis." CONCLUSIONS: The feeding modes of the ancestral metazoan may have been more complex than previously thought, including not only bacterial prey, but also larger eukaryotic cells and organic structures. The ability to feed on large eukaryotic prey could have been a powerful trigger in the formation and development of both aggregative (e.g., joint feeding, which also implies signaling) and clonal (e.g., hypertrophic growth followed by palintomy) multicellular stages that played important roles in the emergence of multicellular animals.},

Wisdom and intellectual integrity demanded that one must desist from unproven utterances and minimize, even in thought, the gap between speculation and established knowledge. The proving power of the intellect or the senses was questioned by the sceptics more than two thousand years ago; but they were browbeaten into confusion by the glory of Newtonian physics. Einstein's results again turned the tables and now very few philosophers or scientists still think that scientific knowledge is, or can be, proven knowledge. But few realize that with this the whole classical structure of intellectual values falls in ruins and has to be replaced: one cannot simply water down the ideal of proven truth - as some logical empiricists do ---to the ideal of'probable truth'1 or ---as some sociologists of knowledge do ---to `truth by {$[$}changing{$]$} consensus'.2},

	Abstract = {Genotypic fitness landscapes are constructed by assessing the fitness of all possible combinations of a given number of mutations. In the last years, several experimental fitness landscapes have been completely resolved. As fitness landscapes are high-dimensional, simple measures of their structure are used as statistics in empirical applications. Epistasis is one of the most relevant features of fitness landscapes. Here we propose a new natural measure of the amount of epistasis based on the correlation of fitness effects of mutations. This measure has a natural interpretation, captures well the interaction between mutations and can be obtained analytically for most landscape models. We discuss how this measure is related to previous measures of epistasis (number of peaks, roughness/slope, fraction of sign epistasis, Fourier-Walsh spectrum) and how it can be easily extended to landscapes with missing data or with fitness ranks only. Furthermore, the dependence of the correlation of fitness effects on mutational distance contains interesting information about the patterns of epistasis. This dependence can be used to uncover the amount and nature of epistatic interactions in a landscape or to discriminate between different landscape models.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT This chapter discusses the developmental origins and evolutionary implications of covariation between traits. These are important factors influencing the evolutionary potential of morphological traits. Strong covariation can constitute an evolutionary constraint because some character combinations are more likely to evolve than others. Modularity is a widespread feature of organismal organization: Groups of traits covary with each other but are relatively independent of other groups of traits. This modularity results from a similar organization of developmental systems, where signaling interactions primarily take place within spatially distinct fields. The covariation among morphological traits can result from direct interactions of the developmental pathways that produce the traits, which take place within developmental modules, or from parallel variation of separate pathways in response to the simultaneous influence of an external factor. These two origins of covariation among traits have different implications for pleiotropy of genes, the evolution of pleiotropy, the total genetic covariance structure, and the resulting evolutionary constraints.},

	Abstract = {Life is the most complex physical phenomenon in the Universe, manifesting an extraordinary diversity of form and function over an enormous scale from the largest animals and plants to the smallest microbes and subcellular units. Despite this many of its most fundamental and complex phenomena scale with size in a surprisingly simple fashion. For example, metabolic rate scales as the 3/4-power of mass over 27 orders of magnitude, from molecular and intracellular levels up to the largest organisms. Similarly, time-scales (such as lifespans and growth rates) and sizes (such as bacterial genome lengths, tree heights and mitochondrial densities) scale with exponents that are typically simple powers of 1/4. The universality and simplicity of these relationships suggest that fundamental universal principles underly much of the coarse-grained generic structure and organisation of living systems. We have proposed a set of principles based on the observation that almost all life is sustained by hierarchical branching networks, which we assume have invariant terminal units, are space-filling and are optimised by the process of natural selection. We show how these general constraints explain quarter power scaling and lead to a quantitative, predictive theory that captures many of the essential features of diverse biological systems. Examples considered include animal circulatory systems, plant vascular systems, growth, mitochondrial densities, and the concept of a universal molecular clock. Temperature considerations, dimensionality and the role of invariants are discussed. Criticisms and controversies associated with this approach are also addressed.},

@article{Smith85,
	Abstract = {Developmental constraints (defined as biases on the production of variant phenotypes or limitations on phenotypic variability caused by the structure, character, composition, or dynamics of the developmental system) undoubtedly play a significant role in evolution. Yet there is little agreement on their importance as compared with selection, drift, and other such factors in shaping evolutionary history. This review distinguishes between "universal" and "local" constraints; it deals primarily with the latter, which apply to a limited range of taxa. Such constraints, typically, can be broken even within the taxa to which they apply, though with varying degrees of difficulty. The origin of constraints is discussed, five distinctive of constraint being explicitly considered. Three means of identifying constraints are set forth, as well as four means of distinguishing developmental from selective constraints. None of the latter (use of a priori adaptive predictions, direct measurement of selection, direct measurement of heritable variation, and use of the comparative method) is foolproof. In the final section, three larger issues regarding the role of developmental constraints in evolution are discussed: the extent to which evolutionary stasis can be explained in developmental terms, the extend to which evolutionary trends and patterns might be a consequence of developmental constraints, and the extent to which various genetic and developmental mechanisms have evolved in virtue of the need of lineages to manifest evolutionary plasticity (or adaptability) if they are to survive. Although no definitive conclusions are reached on these larger issues, we bring recent advances in developmental biology, evolutionary theory, and (to a limited extent) molecular biology to bear on them.},

	Abstract = {Morphological allometry refers to patterns of covariance between body parts resulting from variation in body size. Whether measured during growth (ontogenetic allometry), among individuals at similar developmental stage (static allometry), or among populations or species (evolutionary allometry), allometric relationships are often tight and relatively invariant. Consequently, it has been suggested that allometries have low evolvability and could constrain phenotypic evolution by forcing evolving species along fixed trajectories. Alternatively, allometric relationships may result from natural selection for functional optimization. Despite nearly a century of active research, distinguishing between these alternatives remains difficult, partly due to wide differences in the meaning assigned to the term allometry. In particular, a broad use of the term, encompassing any monotonic relationship between body parts, has become common. This usage breaks the connection to the proportional growth regulation that motivated Huxley's original narrow-sense use of allometry to refer to power-law relationships between traits. Focusing on the narrow-sense definition of allometry, we review here evidence for and against the allometry-as-a-constraint hypothesis. Although the low evolvability and the evolutionary invariance of the static allometric slope observed in some studies suggest a possible constraining effect of this parameter on phenotypic evolution, the lack of knowledge about selection on allometry prevents firm conclusions.},

Extrapolation from relative size relationships in adults to relative growth in ontogeny depends on the variability of slopes and intercepts of ontogenetic vectors relative to variability in length of the vector. If variability in slopes and intercepts is low relative to variability in length, ontogenetic and static allometries will be similar. The similarity of ontogenetic and static allometries was tested by comparing the first principal component, or size vector, for correlations among 48 cranial traits in a cross-sectional ontogenetic sample of rhesus macaques from Cayo Santiago with a static sample from which all age- and sex-related variation had been removed. The vector correlation between the components is high but significantly less than one while two of three allometric patterns apparent in the ontogenetic component are not discernable in the static component. This indicates that there are important differences in size and shape relationships among adults and within ontogenies. Extrapolation from intra- or interspecific phenotypic allometry to evolutionary allometry is shown to depend on the similarity of genetic and phenotypic allometry patterns. Similarity of patterns was tested by comparing the first principal components of the phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlation matrices calculated using standard quantitative genetic methods. The patterns of phenotypic, genetic, and environmental allometry are dissimilar; only the environmental allometries show ontogenetic allometric patterns. This indicates that phenotypic allometry may not be an accurate guide to patterns of evolutionary change in size and shape.},

	N2 = {Sexual selection is among the most powerful of all evolutionary forces. It occurs when individuals within one sex secure mates and produce offspring at the expense of other individuals within the same sex. Darwin was first to recognize the power of sexual selection to change male and female phenotypes, and, in noting that sexual selection is nonubiquitous, Darwin was also first to recognize the importance of mating system---the ``special circumstances''in which reproduction occurs within species. Analyses of mating systems since Darwin have emphasized either the genetic relationships between male and female mating elements, usually among plants, or the numbers of mates males and females may obtain, usually among animals. Combining these schemes yields a quantitative methodology that emphasizes measurement of the sex difference in the variance in relative fitness, as well as phenotypic and genetic correlations underlying reproductive traits that may arise among breeding pairs. Such information predicts the degree and direction of sexual dimorphism within species, it allows the classification of mating systems using existing genetic and life history data, and with information on the spatial and temporal distributions of fertilizations, it may also predict floral morphology in plants. Because this empirical framework identifies selective forces and genetic architectures responsible for observed male-female differences, it compliments discoveries of nucleotide sequence variation and the expression of quantitative traits. Moreover, because this methodology emphasizes the process of evolutionary change, it is easier to test and interpret than frameworks emphasizing parental investment in offspring and its presumed evolutionary outcomes.},

	Abstract = {In his celebrated model of adaptation, Fisher assumed a smooth phenotype fitness map with one optimum. This assumption is at odds with the rugged.....Fisher's geometric model was originally introduced to argue that complex adaptations must occur in small steps because of pleiotropic constraints. When supplemented with the assumption of additivity of mutational effects on phenotypic traits, it provides a simple mechanism for the emergence of genotypic epistasis from the nonlinear mapping of phenotypes to fitness. Of particular interest is the occurrence of reciprocal sign epistasis, which is a necessary condition for multipeaked genotypic fitness landscapes. Here we compute the probability that a pair of randomly chosen mutations interacts sign epistatically, which is found to decrease with increasing phenotypic dimension n, and varies nonmonotonically with the distance from the phenotypic optimum. We then derive expressions for the mean number of fitness maxima in genotypic landscapes comprised of all combinations of L random mutations. This number increases exponentially with L, and the corresponding growth rate is used as a measure of the complexity of the landscape. The dependence of the complexity on the model parameters is found to be surprisingly rich, and three distinct phases characterized by different landscape structures are identified. Our analysis shows that the phenotypic dimension, which is often referred to as phenotypic complexity, does not generally correlate with the complexity of fitness landscapes and that even organisms with a single phenotypic trait can have complex landscapes. Our results further inform the interpretation of experiments where the parameters of Fisher's model have been inferred from data, and help to elucidate which features of empirical fitness landscapes can be described by this model.},

Epistasis is important in predicting phenotype from genotype for an individual. It is also examined in population studies to identify genetic risk factors in complex traits and to predict evolution under selection. Paradoxically, the effects of genotypic context in individuals and populations are distinct and sometimes contradictory. We argue that predicting genotype from phenotype for individuals based on population studies is difficult and, especially in human genetics, likely to result in underestimating the effects of genotypic context.},

@article{Nei75,
	Abstract = {{$[$}When a population goes through a small bottleneck, the genetic variability of the population is expected to decline rapidly but, as soon as population size becomes large, it starts to increase owing to new mutations. This problem is studied mathematically, and the results obtained indicate that the amount of reduction in average heterozygosity per locus depends not only on the 'size of bottleneck' but also on the rate of population growth. If population size increases rapidly after going through a bottleneck, the reduction in average heterozygosity is rather small even if bottleneck size is extremely small. On the other hand, the loss in the average number of alleles per locus is profoundly affected by bottleneck size but not so much by the rate of population growth. This difference occurs mainly because random genetic drift eliminates many low frequency alleles. However, the average number of alleles per locus increases faster than the average heterozygosity when population size is restored. Application of the theory developed to the Bogota population of Drosophila pseudoobscura supports Prakash's postulate that this population has grown very rapidly, starting from a few migrants from a Central or North American population.{$]$}},

@article{Turelli17,
	Abstract = {Mendel (1866) suggested that if many heritable ``factors''contribute to a trait, near-continuous variation could result. Fisher (1918) clarified the connection between Mendelian inheritance and continuous trait variation by assuming many loci, each with small effect, and by informally invoking the central limit theorem. Barton et al. (2017) rigorously analyze the approach to a multivariate Gaussian distribution of the genetic effects for descendants of parents who may be related. This commentary distinguishes three nested approximations, referred to as ``infinitesimal genetics,''``Gaussian descendants''and ``Gaussian population,''each plausibly called ``the infinitesimal model.''The first and most basic is Fisher's ``infinitesimal''approximation of the underlying genetics --namely, many loci, each making a small contribution to the total variance. As Barton et al. (2017) show, in the limit as the number of loci increases (with enough additivity), the distribution of genotypic values for descendants approaches a multivariate Gaussian, whose variance--covariance structure depends only on the relatedness, not the phenotypes, of the parents (or whether their population experiences selection or other processes such as mutation and migration). Barton et al. (2017) call this rigorously defensible ``Gaussian descendants''approximation ``the infinitesimal model.''However, it is widely assumed that Fisher's genetic assumptions yield another Gaussian approximation, in which the distribution of breeding values in a population follows a Gaussian ---even if the population is subject to non-Gaussian selection. This third ``Gaussian population''approximation, is also described as the ``infinitesimal model.''Unlike the ``Gaussian descendants''approximation, this third approximation cannot be rigorously justified, except in a weak-selection limit, even for a purely additive model. Nevertheless, it underlies the two most widely used descriptions of selection-induced changes in trait means and genetic variances, the ``breeder's equation''and the ``Bulmer effect.''Future generations may understand why the ``infinitesimal model''provides such useful approximations in the face of epistasis, linkage, linkage disequilibrium and strong selection.},

Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome---including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways.

	Abstract = {The same mutation can have different effects in different individuals. One important reason for this is that the outcome of a mutation can depend on the genetic context in which it occurs. This dependency is known as epistasis. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to quantify the extent of pairwise and higher-order genetic interactions between mutations through deep mutagenesis of proteins and RNAs. This research has revealed two major components of epistasis: nonspecific genetic interactions caused by nonlinearities in genotype-to-phenotype maps, and specific interactions between particular mutations. Here, we provide an overview of our current understanding of the mechanisms causing epistasis at the molecular level, the consequences of genetic interactions for evolution and genetic prediction, and the applications of epistasis for understanding biology and determining macromolecular structures.},

Complex traits and their evolution have been studied for more than a century, but only in the last decade have genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in humans begun to reveal their genetic basis. Here, we bring these threads of research together to ask how findings from GWASs can further our understanding of the processes that give rise to heritable variation in complex traits and of the genetic basis of complex trait evolution in response to changing selection pressures (i.e., of polygenic adaptation). Conversely, we ask how evolutionary thinking helps us to interpret findings from GWASs and informs related efforts of practical importance.},

Complex traits and their evolution have been studied for more than a century, but only in the last decade have genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in humans begun to reveal their genetic basis. Here, we bring these threads of research together to ask how findings from GWASs can further our understanding of the processes that give rise to heritable variation in complex traits and of the genetic basis of complex trait evolution in response to changing selection pressures (i.e., of polygenic adaptation). Conversely, we ask how evolutionary thinking helps us to interpret findings from GWASs and informs related efforts of practical importance.},

The analogy with statistical physics also reveals that, contrary to a basic tenet of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, the frequencies of adaptive and deleterious substitutions at steady state are equal.

Here, I present an analytical method for solving models of nearly neutral evolution at steady state. The steady state solution applies to any constant fitness landscape under a dynamic of successive fixations, each of which occurs on the background of the population's most recent common ancestor. Because this dynamic neglects the effects of polymorphism in the population beyond the mutant allele under consideration, the steady state solution provides a decent approximation of evolutionary dynamics when the population mutation rate is low (Nu≪1). To demonstrate the method, I apply it to two examples: Fisher's geometric model (FGM), and a simple model of molecular evolution. Since recent papers have studied the steady state behavior of FGM under this dynamic, I analyze its behavior in detail and compare the results with previous work.},

	N2 = {Fitness landscapes map the relationship between genotype and phenotype, and are a core tool for predicting evolutionary processes from the emergence of resistant pathogens to cancer. The topography of fitness landscapes is determined by the environment. However, populations can also dynamically modify their environment, for instance by releasing metabolites to it, and thus they may potentially deform their own adaptive landscape. Using a combination of genome-scale metabolic simulations and experiments with Escherichia coli strains from the Lenski laboratory Long-Term Evolution Experiment, we systematically and quantitatively characterize the deformability of an empirical fitness landscape. We show that fitness landscapes retain their power to forecast evolution over short mutational distances but environment building may attenuate this capacity over longer adaptive trajectories.A fitness landscape is a map between the genotype and its reproductive success in a given environment. The topography of fitness landscapes largely governs adaptive dynamics, constraining evolutionary trajectories and the predictability of evolution. Theory suggests that this topography can be deformed by mutations that produce substantial changes to the environment. Despite its importance, the deformability of fitness landscapes has not been systematically studied beyond abstract models, and little is known about its reach and consequences in empirical systems. Here we have systematically characterized the deformability of the genome-wide metabolic fitness landscape of the bacterium Escherichia coli. Deformability is quantified by the noncommutativity of epistatic interactions, which we experimentally demonstrate in mutant strains on the path to an evolutionary innovation. Our analysis shows that the deformation of fitness landscapes by metabolic mutations rarely affects evolutionary trajectories in the short range. However, mutations with large environmental effects produce long-range landscape deformations in distant regions of the genotype space that affect the fitness of later descendants. Our results therefore suggest that, even in situations in which mutations have strong environmental effects, fitness landscapes may retain their power to forecast evolution over small mutational distances despite the potential attenuation of that power over longer evolutionary trajectories. Our methods and results provide an avenue for integrating adaptive and eco-evolutionary dynamics with complex genetics and genomics.},

Here we study population dynamics in a model where fitness can be inferred from physical properties of proteins under a physiological assumption that loss of stability of any protein encoded by an essential gene confers a lethal phenotype. Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Γgenes can then be represented as diffusion within the Γ-dimensional hypercube with adsorbing boundaries determined, in each dimension, by loss of a protein's stability and, at higher stability, by lack of protein sequences. Solving the diffusion equation whose parameters are derived from the data on point mutations in proteins, we determine a universal distribution of protein stabilities, in agreement with existing data. The theory provides a fundamental relation between mutation rate, maximal genome size, and thermodynamic response of proteins to point mutations. It establishes a universal speed limit on rate of molecular evolution by predicting that populations go extinct (via lethal mutagenesis) when mutation rate exceeds approximately six mutations per essential part of genome per replication for mesophilic organisms and one to two mutations per genome per replication for thermophilic ones. Several RNA viruses function close to the evolutionary speed limit, whereas error correction mechanisms used by DNA viruses and nonmutant strains of bacteria featuring various genome lengths and mutation rates have brought these organisms universally ≈1,000-fold below the natural speed limit.},

The simplicity of the model allows rapid computation of the folding probability of a sequence to any folded conformation. For each robust folder, the network of sequences that share its native structure is identified. The fitness of a sequence is postulated to be a simple function of the number of misfolded molecules that have to be produced to reach a characteristic protein abundance. After fixation probabilities of mutants are computed under a simple population dynamics model, a Markov chain on the fold network is constructed, and the fold-averaged evolution rate is computed. The distribution of the logarithm of the evolution rates across distinct networks exhibits a peak with a long tail on the low rate side and resembles the universal empirical distribution of the evolutionary rates more closely than either distribution resembles the log-normal distribution. The results suggest that the universal distribution of the evolutionary rates of protein-coding genes is a direct consequence of the basic physics of protein folding.},

	Abstract = {Protein structures strongly influence molecular evolution. In particular, the evolutionary rate of a protein site depends on the number of its native contacts. Stability-constrained models of protein evolution consider this influence of protein structure on evolution by predicting the effect of mutations on the stability of the native state, but they currently neglect how mutations affect the protein structure. These models predict that buried protein sites with more native contacts are more constrained by natural selection and less variable, as observed. Nevertheless, previous work did not consider the stability against compact misfolded conformations, although it is known that the negative design that destabilizes these misfolded conformations influences protein evolution significantly. Here, we show that stability-constrained models that consider misfolding predict that site-specific sequence entropy and substitution rate peak at amphiphilic sites with an intermediate number of contacts, as these sites are less constrained than exposed sites with few contacts whose hydrophobicity must be limited. This result holds both for a mean-field model with independent sites and for a pairwise model that takes as a reference the wild-type sequence, but it contrasts with the observations that indicate that the entropy and the substitution rate decrease monotonically with the number of contacts. Our work suggests that stability-constrained models overestimate the tolerance of amphiphilic sites against mutations, either because of the limits of the free energy function or, more importantly in our opinion, because they do not consider how mutations perturb the native protein structure.},

	Abstract = {The rate of evolution varies among sites within proteins owing to structural and functional constraints.The main pattern of variation is due to structural constraints: evolutionary rates increase from the slowly evolving, solvent-inaccessible, tightly packed and rigid protein interior, to the rapidly evolving, solvent-exposed and loosely packed protein surface.Functional constraints result in the slow evolution of sites that are directly involved in protein function and their neighbours. There may also be longer range effects on distant sites.According to mechanistic biophysical models, site-specific evolutionary rates are related to mutational changes of thermodynamic stability. Structural predictors, such as solvent accessibility and local packing, would be proxies of mutational stability changes.Our understanding of rate variation among sites remains limited: at best, current models explain approximately 60{\%} of the observed variance in site-specific rates, and in many cases these models explain considerably less.To make further progress, we need to develop better rate inference methods, complete the list of structural and functional molecular features that correlate with rates, and undertake further research on theoretical models derived from first principles.},

@article{Marcos15,
	Abstract = { In protein evolution, due to functional and biophysical constraints, the rates of amino acid substitution differ from site to site. Among the best predictors of site-specific rates are solvent accessibility and packing density. The packing density measure that best correlates with rates is the weighted contact number (WCN), the sum of inverse square distances between a site's Cα and the Cα of the other sites. According to a mechanistic stress model proposed recently, rates are determined by packing because mutating packed sites stresses and destabilizes the protein's active conformation. While WCN is a measure of Cα packing, mutations replace side chains. Here, we consider whether a site's evolutionary divergence is constrained by main-chain packing or side-chain packing. To address this issue, we extended the stress theory to model side chains explicitly. The theory predicts that rates should depend solely on side-chain contact density. We tested this prediction on a data set of structurally and functionally diverse monomeric enzymes. We compared side-chain contact density with main-chain contact density measures and with relative solvent accessibility (RSA). We found that side-chain contact density is the best predictor of rate variation among sites (it explains 39.2% of the variation). Moreover, the independent contribution of main-chain contact density measures and RSA are negligible. Thus, as predicted by the stress theory, site-specific evolutionary rates are determined by side-chain packing. },

	Abstract = {Adequate representations of protein evolution should consider how the acceptance of mutations depends on the sequence context in which they arise. However, epistatic interactions among sites in a protein result in hererogeneities in the substitution rate, both temporal and spatial, that are beyond the capabilities of current models. Here we use parallels between amino acid substitutions and chemical reaction kinetics to develop an improved theory of protein evolution. We constructed a mechanistic framework for modelling amino acid substitution rates that uses the formalisms of statistical mechanics, with principles of population genetics underlying the analysis. Theoretical analyses and computer simulations of proteins under purifying selection for thermodynamic stability show that substitution rates and the stabilization of resident amino acids (the `evolutionary Stokes shift') can be predicted from biophysics and the effect of sequence entropy alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that substitutions predominantly occur when epistatic interactions result in near neutrality; substitution rates are determined by how often epistasis results in such nearly neutral conditions. This theory provides a general framework for modelling protein sequence change under purifying selection, potentially explains patterns of convergence and mutation rates in real proteins that are incompatible with previous models, and provides a better null model for the detection of adaptive changes.},

Furthermore, it has become clear that rate variation has a systematic component: rate of molecular evolution can vary consistently with species body size, population dynamics, lifestyle and location. This suggests that the rate of molecular evolution should be considered part of life-history variation between species, which must be taken into account when interpreting DNA sequence differences between lineages.

	Abstract = {Enzymes speed up reactions that would otherwise be too slow to sustain the metabolism of self-replicators. Yet, most enzymes seem only moderately efficient, exhibiting kinetic parameters orders of magnitude lower than their expected physically achievable maxima and spanning over surprisingly large ranges of values. Here, we question how these parameters evolve using a mechanistic model where enzyme efficiency is a key component of individual competition for resources. We show that kinetic parameters are under strong directional selection only up to a point, above which enzymes appear to evolve under near-neutrality, thereby confirming the qualitative observation of other modelling approaches. While the existence of a large fitness plateau could potentially explain the extensive variation in enzyme features reported, we show using a population genetics model that such a widespread distribution is an unlikely outcome of evolution on a common landscape, as mutation-selection-drift balance occupy a narrow area even when very moderate biases towards lower efficiency are considered. Instead, differences in the evolutionary context encountered by each enzyme should be involved, such that each evolves on an individual, unique landscape. Our results point to drift and effective population size playing an important role, along with the kinetics of nutrient transporters, the tolerance to high concentrations of intermediate metabolites, and the reversibility of reactions. Enzyme concentration also shapes selection on kinetic parameters, but we show that the joint evolution of concentration and efficiency does not yield extensive variance in evolutionary outcomes when documented costs to protein expression are applied.},

To quantify the fitness effects of synonymous mutations and their potential impact on adaptation on a fitness landscape, we use a new software based on Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods and re-estimate selection coefficients of all possible codon mutations across 9 amino acid positions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 across 6 environments. We quantify the distribution of fitness effects of synonymous mutations and show that it is dominated by many mutations of small or no effect and few mutations of larger effect. We then compare the shape of the codon fitness landscape across amino acid positions and environments, and quantify how the consideration of synonymous fitness effects changes the evolutionary dynamics on these fitness landscapes. Together these results highlight a possible role of synonymous mutations in adaptation and indicate the potential mis-inference when they are neglected in fitness landscape studies.},

A better understanding of variation in landscape structure across species and environments is thus necessary to understand and predict how populations will adapt. An increasing number of experiments investigate the properties of fitness landscapes by identifying mutations, constructing genotypes with combinations of these mutations, and measuring the fitness of these genotypes. Yet these empirical landscapes represent a very small sample of the vast space of all possible genotypes, and this sample is often biased by the protocol used to identify mutations. Here we develop a rigorous statistical framework based on Approximate Bayesian Computation to address these concerns and use this flexible framework to fit a broad class of phenotypic fitness models (including Fisher's model) to 26 empirical landscapes representing nine diverse biological systems. Despite uncertainty owing to the small size of most published empirical landscapes, the inferred landscapes have similar structure in similar biological systems. Surprisingly, goodness-of-fit tests reveal that this class of phenotypic models, which has been successful so far in interpreting experimental data, is a plausible in only three of nine biological systems. More precisely, although Fisher's model was able to explain several statistical properties of the landscapes---including the mean and SD of selection and epistasis coefficients---it was often unable to explain the full structure of fitness landscapes.},

Given that a single protein may serve more than one function, fitness should be assessed in several dimensions. In the present study we have explored individual mutational steps leading to a triple-point-mutated human GST (glutathione transferase) A2-2 displaying enhanced activity with azathioprine. A total of eight alternative substrates were used to monitor the diverse evolutionary trajectories. The epistatic effects of the mutations on catalytic activity were variable in sign and magnitude and depended on the substrate used, showing that epistasis is a multidimensional quality. Evidently, the multidimensional fitness landscape can lead to alternative trajectories resulting in enzymes optimized for features other than the selectable markers relevant at the origin of the evolutionary process. In this manner the evolutionary response is robust and can adapt to changing environmental conditions.},

@article{Jones20,
	Abstract = {A central objective in biology is to link adaptive evolution in a gene to structural and/or functional phenotypic novelties. Yet most analytic methods make inferences mainly from either phenotypic data or genetic data alone. A small number of models have been developed to infer correlations between the rate of molecular evolution and changes in a discrete or continuous life history trait. But such correlations are not necessarily evidence of adaptation. Here, we present a novel approach called the phenotype--genotype branch-site model (PG-BSM) designed to detect evidence of adaptive codon evolution associated with discrete-state phenotype evolution. An episode of adaptation is inferred under standard codon substitution models when there is evidence of positive selection in the form of an elevation in the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate ratio {\$}{$\backslash$}omega{\$} to a value {\$}{$\backslash$}omega {$>$} 1{\$}. As it is becoming increasingly clear that {\$}{$\backslash$}omega {$>$} 1{\$} can occur without adaptation, the PG-BSM was formulated to infer an instance of adaptive evolution without appealing to evidence of positive selection. The null model makes use of a covarion-like component to account for general heterotachy (i.e., random changes in the evolutionary rate at a site over time). The alternative model employs samples of the phenotypic evolutionary history to test for phenomenological patterns of heterotachy consistent with specific mechanisms of molecular adaptation. These include 1) a persistent increase/decrease in {\$}{$\backslash$}omega{\$} at a site following a change in phenotype (the pattern) consistent with an increase/decrease in the functional importance of the site (the mechanism); and 2) a transient increase in {\$}{$\backslash$}omega{\$} at a site along a branch over which the phenotype changed (the pattern) consistent with a change in the site's optimal amino acid (the mechanism). Rejection of the null is followed by post hoc analyses to identify sites with strongest evidence for adaptation in association with changes in the phenotype as well as the most likely evolutionary history of the phenotype. Simulation studies based on a novel method for generating mechanistically realistic signatures of molecular adaptation show that the PG-BSM has good statistical properties. Analyses of real alignments show that site patterns identified post hoc are consistent with the specific mechanisms of adaptation included in the alternate model. Further simulation studies show that the covarion-like component of the PG-BSM plays a crucial role in mitigating recently discovered statistical pathologies associated with confounding by accounting for heterotachy-by-any-cause. {$[$}Adaptive evolution; branch-site model; confounding; mutation-selection; phenotype--genotype.{$]$}},

To this end, codon-based evolutionary models have been proposed as pertinent means of studying long-range evolutionary patterns and are widely used. However, these approaches have not yet consolidated results from amino acid level phylogenetic studies showing that selection acting on proteins displays strong site-specific effects, which translate into heterogeneous amino acid propensities across the columns of alignments; related codon-level studies have instead focused on either modeling a single selective context for all codon columns, or a separate selective context for each codon column, with the former strategy deemed too simplistic and the latter deemed overparameterized. Here, we integrate recent developments in nonparametric statistical approaches to propose a probabilistic model that accounts for the heterogeneity of amino acid fitness profiles across the coding positions of a gene. We apply the model to a dozen real protein-coding gene alignments and find it to produce biologically plausible inferences, for instance, as pertaining to site-specific amino acid constraints, as well as distributions of scaled selection coefficients. In their account of mutational features as well as the heterogeneous regimes of selection at the amino acid level, the modeling approaches studied here can form a backdrop for several extensions, accounting for other selective features, for variable population size, or for subtleties of mutational features, all with parameterizations couched within population-genetic theory.},

	Abstract = {The best known genes of microbes, mice and men are those that specify enzymes. Wild type, mutant and heterozygote for variants of such genes differ in the catalytic activity at the step in the enzyme network specified by the gene in question. The effect on the respective phenotypes of such changes in catalytic activity, however, is not defined by the enzymes change as estimated by in vitro determination of the activities obtained from the extracts of the three groups. In vivo enzymes do not act in isolation, but are kinetically linked to other enzymes via their substrates and products. These interactions modify the effect of enzyme variation on the phenotype, depending on the nature and quantity of the other enzymes present. An output of such a system, say a flux, is therefore a systemic property, and its response to variation at one locus must be measured in the whole system. This response is best described by the sensitivity coefficient, Z, while is defined by the fractional change in flux over the fractional change in enzyme activity. (formula: see text). Its magnitude determines the extent to which a particular enzyme "controls" a particular flux or phenotype and, implicitly, determines the values that the three phenotypes will have. There are as many sensitivity coefficients for a given flux as there are enzymes in the system. It can be shown that the sum of all such coefficients equals unity. (formula: see text). Since n, the number of enzymes, is large, this summation property results in the individual coefficients being small. The effect of making a large change in enzyme activity therefore usually results in only a negligible change in flux. A reduction to 50{\%} activity in the heterozygote, a common feature for many mutants, is therefore not expected to be detectable in the phenotype. The mutant would therefore be described as "recessive". The widespread occurrence of recessive mutants is thus seen to be the inevitable consequence of the kinetic structure of enzyme networks. The ad hoc hypothesis of "modifiers" selected to maximize the fitness of the heterozygote, as proposed by Fisher, is therefore unnecessary. It is based on the false general expectation of an intermediate phenotype in the heterozygote. Wright's analysis, substantially sound in its approach, proposed selection of a "safety factor" in enzyme activity. The derivation of the summation property explains why such safety factors are automatically present in almost all enzymes without selection.},

	Abstract = {It is an open question whether phenomena such as phenotypic robustness to mutation evolve as adaptations or are simply an inherent property of genetic systems. As a case study, we examine this question with regard to dominance in metabolic physiology. Traditionally the conclusion that has been derived from Metabolic Control Analysis has been that dominance is an inevitable property of multi-enzyme systems and hence does not require an evolutionary explanation. This view is based on a mathematical result commonly referred to as the flux summation theorem. However it is shown here that for mutations involving finite changes (of any magnitude) in enzyme concentration, the flux summation theorem can only hold in a very restricted set of conditions. Using both analytical and simulation results we show that for finite changes, the summation theorem is only valid in cases where the relationship between genotype and phenotype is linear and devoid of non-linearities in the form of epistasis. Such an absence of epistasis is unlikely in metabolic systems. As an example, we show that epistasis can arise in scenarios where we assume generic non-linearities such as those caused by enzyme saturation. In such cases dominance levels can be modified by mutations that affect saturation levels. The implication is that dominance is not a necessary property of metabolic systems and that it can be subject to evolutionary modification.},

	Abstract = {While mutational biases strongly influence neutral molecular evolution, the role of mutational biases in shaping the course of adaptation is less clear. Here we consider the frequency of transitions relative to transversions among adaptive substitutions. Because mutation rates for transitions are higher than those for transversions, if mutational biases influence the dynamics of adaptation, then transitions should be overrepresented among documented adaptive substitutions. To test this hypothesis, we assembled two sets of data on putatively adaptive amino acid replacements that have occurred in parallel during evolution, either in nature or in the laboratory. We find that the frequency of transitions in these data sets is much higher than would be predicted under a null model where mutation has no effect. Our results are qualitatively similar even if we restrict ourself to changes that have occurred, not merely twice, but three or more times. These results suggest that the course of adaptation is biased by mutation.},

Until now it had been assumed that all cells in a population engage in the outgrowth on the second sugar after major metabolic adaptation of enzymatic composition has occurred, which takes time (hence the lag phase in growth). Here, we show that actually only a subpopulation is fit enough to partake in the second growth phase and present an evolutionary model, suggesting that this phenomenon might entail a bet-hedging strategy that helps bacteria adapt to the unexpectedly changing environment.When bacteria grow in a medium with two sugars, they first use the preferred sugar and only then start metabolizing the second one. After the first exponential growth phase, a short lag phase of nongrowth is observed, a period called the diauxie lag phase. It is commonly seen as a phase in which the bacteria prepare themselves to use the second sugar. Here we reveal that, in contrast to the established concept of metabolic adaptation in the lag phase, two stable cell types with alternative metabolic strategies emerge and coexist in a culture of the bacterium Lactococcus lactis. Only one of them continues to grow. The fraction of each metabolic phenotype depends on the level of catabolite repression and the metabolic state-dependent induction of stringent response, as well as on epigenetic cues. Furthermore, we show that the production of alternative metabolic phenotypes potentially entails a bet-hedging strategy. This study sheds new light on phenotypic heterogeneity during various lag phases occurring in microbiology and biotechnology and adjusts the generally accepted explanation of enzymatic adaptation proposed by Monod and shared by scientists for more than half a century.},

@article{Hermisson03,
	Abstract = {We consider the effects of epistasis in a polygenic trait in the balance of mutation and stabilizing selection. The main issues are the genetic variation maintained in equilibrium and the evolution of the mutational effect distribution. The model assumes symmetric mutation and a continuum of alleles at all loci. Epistasis is modeled proportional to pairwise products of the single-locus effects. A general analytical formalism is developed. Assuming linkage equilibrium, we derive results for the equilibrium mutation load and the genetic and mutational variance in the house of cards and the Gaussian approximation. The additive genetic variation maintained in mutation-selection balance is reduced by any pattern of the epistatic interactions. The mutational variance, in contrast, is often increased. Large differences in mutational effects among loci emerge, and a negative correlation among (standard mean) locus mutation effects and mutation rates is predicted. Contrary to the common view since Waddington, we find that stabilizing selection in general does not lead to canalization of the trait. We propose that canalization as a target of selection instead occurs at the genic level. Here, primarily genes with a high mutation rate are buffered, often at the cost of decanalization of other genes. An intuitive interpretation of this view is given in the discussion.},

@article{Hansen13,
	Abstract = {{$[$}Organisms are built from thousands of genes that interact in complex ways. Still, the mathematical theory of evolution is dominated by a gene-by-gene perspective in which genes are assumed to have the same effects regardless of genetic background. Gene interaction, or epistasis, plays a role in some theoretical developments such as the evolution of recombination, reproductive isolation, and canalization, but is strikingly missing from our standard accounts of phenotypic adaptation. This absence is most puzzling within the field of quantitative genetics, which, despite its polygenic perspective and elaborate statistical representation of epistasis, has not found a single important role for gene interaction in evolution. To the contrary, there is a widespread consensus that epistasis is evolutionary inert, and that all we need to know to predict evolutionary dynamics is the additive component of the genetic variance. This view may have roots in convenience, but also in theoretical results showing that the response to selection derived from epistatic variance components is not permanent and will decay when selection is relaxed. I show that these results are tied to a conceptual confusion, and are misleading as general statements about the significance of epistasis for the selection response and adaptation.{$]$}},

	N2 = {Summary 1 The role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution has historically been a contentious issue because of debate over whether plasticity shields genotypes from selection or generates novel opportunities for selection to act. Because plasticity encompasses diverse adaptive and non-adaptive responses to environmental variation, no single conceptual framework adequately predicts the diverse roles of plasticity in evolutionary change. 2 Different types of phenotypic plasticity can uniquely contribute to adaptive evolution when populations are faced with new or altered environments. Adaptive plasticity should promote establishment and persistence in a new environment, but depending on how close the plastic response is to the new favoured phenotypic optimum dictates whether directional selection will cause adaptive divergence between populations. Further, non-adaptive plasticity in response to stressful environments can result in a mean phenotypic response being further away from the favoured optimum or alternatively increase the variance around the mean due to the expression of cryptic genetic variation. The expression of cryptic genetic variation can facilitate adaptive evolution if by chance it results in a fitter phenotype. 3 We conclude that adaptive plasticity that places populations close enough to a new phenotypic optimum for directional selection to act is the only plasticity that predictably enhances fitness and is most likely to facilitate adaptive evolution on ecological time-scales in new environments. However, this type of plasticity is likely to be the product of past selection on variation that may have been initially non-adaptive. 4 We end with suggestions on how future empirical studies can be designed to better test the importance of different kinds of plasticity to adaptive evolution.},

	Abstract = {{$[$}During the last decade there has been a rapidly growing interest in the study of phenotypic plasticity in animals. Confused terminology in this field of research may be one reason why the focus of many studies is not as clear as it could be. The field of plasticity highlights the general problem of demonstrating adaptation. We discuss the terminology and methodology of plasticity studies, with particular reference to the question of which patterns should be considered evidence for plasticity as an adaptation to the environment, and how to find such evidence. We suggest a terminology where plasticity can be "adaptive" (i.e. beneficial, and maintained by selection) with respect to a function without strictly being an adaptation for it (evolutionary origin linked to this function), and vice versa. Modifications of the original reaction norm, seen today as differences in plasticity between populations and species, can be adaptations for a function even when the plasticity itself is not (it may follow from constraints or from selection for another function). We selectively review cases reported as evidence of adaptive plasticity in animal morphology and life history, choosing examples from a wide range of taxa to illustrate our criteria for what should be called "adaptive" and "adaptation" when applied to plasticity.{$]$}},

One possible explanation is the difficulty of designing experiments including the relevant range of temporal grains and the appropriate environmental trade-offs. Here, we experimentally explore the impact of the grain on the diversification of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 in a temporally fluctuating environment by including 20 different pairs of environments and four temporal grains. In general, higher levels of diversity were observed at intermediate temporal grains. This resulted in part from the enhanced capacity of disruptive selection to generate negative genotypic correlations in performance at intermediate grains. However, the evolution of reciprocal specialization was an uncommon outcome. Although the temporal heterogeneity is in theory less powerful than the spatial heterogeneity to generate and maintain the diversity, our results show that diversification under temporal heterogeneity is possible provided appropriate environmental grains.},

	Abstract = {The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has been recently suggested as an example of bet-hedging in microbes. In the presence of resources, amoebae reproduce as unicellular organisms. Resource depletion, however, leads to a starvation phase in which the population splits between aggregators, which form a fruiting body made of a stalk and resistant spores, and non-aggregators, which remain as vegetative cells. Spores are favored when starvation periods are long, but vegetative cells can exploit resources in environments where food replenishes quickly. The investment in aggregators versus non-aggregators can therefore be understood as a bet-hedging strategy that evolves in response to stochastic starvation times. A genotype (or strategy) is defined by the balance between each type of cells. In this framework, if the ecological conditions on a patch are defined in terms of the mean starvation time (i.e. time between the onset of starvation and the arrival of a new food pulse), a single genotype dominates each environment, which is inconsistent with the huge genetic diversity observed in nature. Here we investigate whether seasonality, represented by a periodic, wet-dry alternation in the mean starvation times, allows the coexistence of several strategies in a single patch. We study this question in a non-spatial (well-mixed) setting in which different strains compete for a common pool of resources over a sequence of growth-starvation cycles. We find that seasonality induces a temporal storage effect that can promote the stable coexistence of multiple genotypes. Two conditions need to be met in our model. First, there has to be a temporal niche partitioning (two well-differentiated habitats within the year), which requires not only different mean starvation times between seasons but also low variance within each season. Second, each season's well-adapted strain has to grow and create a large enough population that permits its survival during the subsequent unfavorable season, which requires the number of growth-starvation cycles within each season to be sufficiently large. These conditions allow the coexistence of two bet-hedging strategies. Additional tradeoffs among life-history traits can expand the range of coexistence and increase the number of coexisting strategies, contributing toward explaining the genetic diversity observed in D. discoideum. Although focused on this cellular slime mold, our results are general and may be easily extended to other microbes.},

	N2 = {A key question in evolutionary biology is: What maintains the abundant genetic variation observed in natural populations? Many organisms experience some seasonality in their habitats, and, if they have multiple generations per year, seasonally fluctuating selection is a potentially powerful mechanism to maintain polymorphism. However, previous research has argued that this occurs rarely. Inspired by recent empirical findings, we reevaluate the potential of seasonally fluctuating selection to simultaneously maintain polymorphism at many loci in the genome. We obtain a more general condition for the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism by seasonally fluctuating selection. This condition may plausibly be satisfied for many species and does not suffer from problems of previous models.Most natural populations are affected by seasonal changes in temperature, rainfall, or resource availability. Seasonally fluctuating selection could potentially make a large contribution to maintaining genetic polymorphism in populations. However, previous theory suggests that the conditions for multilocus polymorphism are restrictive. Here, we explore a more general class of models with multilocus seasonally fluctuating selection in diploids. In these models, the multilocus genotype is mapped to fitness in two steps. The first mapping is additive across loci and accounts for the relative contributions of heterozygous and homozygous loci---that is, dominance. The second step uses a nonlinear fitness function to account for the strength of selection and epistasis. Using mathematical analysis and individual-based simulations, we show that stable polymorphism at many loci is possible if currently favored alleles are sufficiently dominant. This general mechanism, which we call ``segregation lift,''requires seasonal changes in dominance, a phenomenon that may arise naturally in situations with antagonistic pleiotropy and seasonal changes in the relative importance of traits for fitness. Segregation lift works best under diminishing-returns epistasis, is not affected by problems of genetic load, and is robust to differences in parameters across loci and seasons. Under segregation lift, loci can exhibit conspicuous seasonal allele-frequency fluctuations, but often fluctuations may be small and hard to detect. An important direction for future work is to formally test for segregation lift in empirical data and to quantify its contribution to maintaining genetic variation in natural populations.},

	Abstract = {Much of quantitative genetics is based on the 'infinitesimal model', under which selection has a negligible effect on the genetic variance. This is typically justified by assuming a very large number of loci with additive effects. However, it applies even when genes interact, provided that the number of loci is large enough that selection on each of them is weak relative to random drift. In the long term, directional selection will change allele frequencies, but even then, the effects of epistasis on the ultimate change in trait mean due to selection may be modest. Stabilising selection can maintain many traits close to their optima, even when the underlying alleles are weakly selected. However, the number of traits that can be optimised is apparently limited to ~4N(e) by the 'drift load', and this is hard to reconcile with the apparent complexity of many organisms. Just as for the mutation load, this limit can be evaded by a particular form of negative epistasis. A more robust limit is set by the variance in reproductive success. This suggests that selection accumulates information most efficiently in the infinitesimal regime, when selection on individual alleles is weak, and comparable with random drift. A review of evidence on selection strength suggests that although most variance in fitness may be because of alleles with large N(e)s, substantial amounts of adaptation may be because of alleles in the infinitesimal regime, in which epistasis has modest effects.},

	Abstract = {Prolonged seed dormancy in desert annuals is thought to be an adaptation to environmental uncertainty. Germination spread over several years could reduce the year-to-year variation in the fitness of a genotype. Previous work has demonstrated that, for a number of species, not all viable seeds germinate under one set of conditions in the first year, but the subsequent fate of the dormant seeds has not been tested. In this study, germination experiments were performed on seeds of six species of winter annuals from Portal, Arizona. Seeds that do not germinate under good conditions in the first year germinate under the same conditions in subsequent years. However, germination fractions in the first 2 yr are not equal fractions of remaining viable seeds, which is the theoretical optimal behavior, and the germination distributions differ greatly among species. Germination under good conditions following a year of bad conditions for germination also differs among species. Germination behavior is age-dependent, and germination trials conducted on seeds of unknown ages from soil samples may give misleading results. These results indicate that seed dormancy acts as a form of bet hedging but that selection for an optimal distribution of germination across years may be weak.},

	Abstract = {Spreading of emergence over several years due to prolonged diapause in some larvae was shown in the chestnut weevil. Depending on the year the larvae buried themselves in the ground, 32-56% of live adults emerged after 2 or 3 years of underground life. Variability in the duration of diapause was assumed to correspond to tactics of adaptative "coin-flipping" plasticity. This plasticity must allow the chestnut weevil to respond to the unpredictability of its habitat as measured by the irregularity of chestnut production and summer drought. Indeed, fecundity and adult longevity did not lessen after 2 years of underground life. No drastic decrease in the population size of weevils occurs after bad years; for instance when the number of chestnuts on the study tree is less than 10 000, passers-by can collect all the fruit and about 95% of larvae developing in chestnuts are destroyed. Diapause nature (simple or prolonged) may be related to moisture and gas rates in the ground from October to December. These factors acting in autumn are not known to be involved in the physiological mechanisms that control the production of chestnuts.},

Neither the expression of genetic variation nor plasticity of the usual sort, it represents a kind of variation that is random, yet adaptive. A result of decision-theoretic strategy-mixing, such variation is needed in order to maximize long-term fitness in the face of unpredictable short-term temporal fluctuations in the environment. The variation is a product of the action of genetically controlled stochastic processes; metaphorically, it is produced because individuals are genetically programmed to ``flip coins''to decide what characteristics to adopt. Thus it is not the variable phenotypic traits themselves that are genetically specified, but only the nature of the coin-flipping process that will ultimately determine them. It is shown that coin-flipping strategies of this kind are robust and can evolve under a variety of conditions.},

	Abstract = {We studied five chemically distinct but related 1,3,5-triazine antifolates with regard to their effects on growth of a set of mutants in dihydrofolate reductase. The mutants comprise a combinatorially complete data set of all 16 possible combinations of four amino acid replacements associated with resistance to pyrimethamine in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Pyrimethamine was a mainstay medication for malaria for many years, and it is still in use in intermittent treatment during pregnancy or as a partner drug in artemisinin combination therapy. Our goal was to investigate the extent to which the alleles yield similar adaptive topographies and patterns of epistasis across chemically related drugs. We find that the adaptive topographies are indeed similar with the same or closely related alleles being fixed in computer simulations of stepwise evolution. For all but one of the drugs the topography features at least one suboptimal fitness peak. Our data are consistent with earlier results indicating that third order and higher epistatic interactions appear to contribute only modestly to the overall adaptive topography, and they are largely conserved. In regard to drug development, our data suggest that higher-order interactions are likely to be of little value as an advisory tool in the choice of lead compounds.},

@article{Dasmeh14,
	Abstract = {Understanding the relative contributions of various evolutionary processes---purifying selection, neutral drift, and adaptation---is fundamental to evolutionary biology. A common metric to distinguish these processes is the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (i.e., dN/dS) interpreted from the neutral theory as a null model. However, from biophysical considerations, mutations have non-negligible effects on the biophysical properties of proteins such as folding stability. In this work, we investigated how stability affects the rate of protein evolution in phylogenetic trees by using simulations that combine explicit protein sequences with associated stability changes. We first simulated myoglobin evolution in phylogenetic trees with a biophysically realistic approach that accounts for 3D structural information and estimates of changes in stability upon mutation. We then compared evolutionary rates inferred directly from simulation to those estimated using maximum-likelihood (ML) methods. We found that the dN/dS estimated by ML methods (ωML) is highly predictive of the per gene dN/dS inferred from the simulated phylogenetic trees. This agreement is strong in the regime of high stability where protein evolution is neutral. At low folding stabilities and under mutation-selection balance, we observe deviations from neutrality (per gene dN/dS {$>$} 1 and dN/dS {$<$} 1). We showed that although per gene dN/dS is robust to these deviations, ML tests for positive selection detect statistically significant per site dN/dS {$>$} 1. Altogether, we show how protein biophysics affects the dN/dS estimations and its subsequent interpretation. These results are important for improving the current approaches for detecting positive selection.},

In protein evolution, there is strong support for the importance and prevalence of epistasis but the quantitative and relative contribution of various factors to epistasis are poorly known. Here, we determine the contribution of selection for folding stability to epistasis in protein evolution. By combining theoretical estimates of the rates of molecular evolution and the nonlinear mapping between protein folding thermodynamics and fitness, we show that the simple selection for folding stability imposes at least \~{}30{\%} to \~{}40{\%} epistasis in long-term protein evolution. Estimating the contribution of governing factors in molecular evolution such as protein folding stability to epistasis will provide a better understanding of epistasis that could improve methods in molecular evolution.},

	Abstract = {We study self-replicating molecules under externally varying conditions. Changing conditions such as temperature variations and/or alterations in the environment's resource composition lead to both non-constant replication and decay rates of the molecules. In general, therefore, molecular evolution takes place in a fluctuating rather than a static fitness landscape. We incorporate dynamic replication and decay rates into the standard quasispecies theory of molecular evolution, and show that for periodic time-dependencies, a system of evolving molecules enters a limit cycle for t→∞. For fast periodic changes, we show that molecules adapt to the time-averaged fitness landscape, whereas for slow changes they track the variations in the landscape arbitrarily closely. We derive a general approximation method that allows us to calculate the attractor of time-periodic landscapes, and demonstrate using several examples that the results of the approximation and the limiting cases of very slow and very fast changes are in perfect agreement. We also discuss landscapes with arbitrary time dependencies, and show that very fast changes again lead to a system that adapts to the time-averaged landscape. Finally, we analyze the dynamics of a finite population of molecules in a dynamic landscape, and discuss its relation to the infinite population limit.},

	N2 = {Abstract Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in pathogenic strains of bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), adversely impacts personal and public health. In this study, we examine competing hypotheses for the evolution of AMR including (i) ?genetic capitalism? in which genotypes that confer antibiotic resistance are gained and not often lost in lineages, and (ii) ?stabilizing selection? in which genotypes that confer antibiotic resistance are gained and lost often. To test these hypotheses, we assembled a dataset that includes annotations for 409 AMR genotypes and a phylogenetic tree based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms from 29 255 isolates of E. coli collected over the past 134 years. We used phylogenetic methods to count the times each AMR genotype was gained and lost across the tree and used model-based clustering of the genotypes with respect to their gain and loss rates. We demonstrate that many genotypes cluster to support the hypothesis for genetic capitalism while a few genotypes cluster to support the hypothesis for stabilizing selection. Comparing the sets of genotypes that fall under each of the hypotheses, we found a statistically significant difference in the breakdown of resistance mechanisms through which the AMR genotypes function. The result that many AMR genotypes cluster under genetic capitalism reflects that strong positive selective forces, primarily induced by human industrialization of antibiotics, outweigh the potential fitness costs to the bacterial lineages for carrying the AMR genotypes. We expect genetic capitalism to further drive bacterial lineages to resist antibiotics. We find that antibiotics that function via replacement and efflux tend to behave under stabilizing selection and thus may be valuable in an antibiotic cycling strategy.},

@article{Wagner96,
	Abstract = {{$[$}The fact that phenotypic evolution can be studied on a character by character basis suggests that the body is composed of locally integrated units. These units can be considered as modular parts of the body which integrate functionally related characters into units of evolutionary transformation. These units may either emerge spontaneously by self-organization, or may be the product of natural selection. A selection scenario that could explain the origin of modular units needs to explain the differential suppression of pleiotropic effects between different modules and the augmentation of pleiotropic effects among the elements within the module. Four scenarios are discussed: selection for adaptation rate, constructional selection, stabilizing selection and a combination of directional and stabilizing selection. It is concluded that a combination of directional and stabilizing selection is a prevalent mode of selection and a likely explanation for the evolution of modularity.{$]$}},

@article{Chesmore16,
	Abstract = {Pleiotropy has been claimed to constrain gene evolution but specific mechanisms and extent of these constraints have been difficult to demonstrate. The expansion of molecular data makes it possible to investigate these pleiotropic effects. Few classes of genes have been characterized as intensely as human transcription factors (TFs). We therefore analyzed the evolutionary rates of full TF proteins, along with their DNA binding domains and protein-protein interacting domains (PID) in light of the degree of pleiotropy, measured by the number of TF-TF interactions, or the number of DNA-binding targets. Data were extracted from the ENCODE Chip-Seq dataset, the String v 9.2 database, and the NHGRI GWAS catalog. Evolutionary rates of proteins and domains were calculated using the PAML CodeML package. Our analysis shows that the numbers of TF-TF interactions and DNA binding targets associated with constrained gene evolution; however, the constraint caused by the number of DNA binding targets was restricted to the DNA binding domains, whereas the number of TF-TF interactions constrained the full protein and did so more strongly. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the number of protein-PIDs and the evolutionary rates of the protein-PIDs. These findings show that not only does pleiotropy associate with constrained protein evolution but the constraint differs by domain function. Finally, we show that GWAS associated TF genes are more highly pleiotropic : The GWAS data illustrates that mutations in highly pleiotropic genes are more likely to be associated with disease phenotypes.},

Pleiotropy has had an important influence on the fields of physiological and medical genetics as well as on evolutionary biology. Different approaches to the study of pleiotropy have led to incongruence in the way that it is perceived and discussed among researchers in these fields. Furthermore, our understanding of the term has changed quite a bit since 1910, particularly in light of modern molecular data.

Whether codon usage is also generally shaped by natural selection in large organisms, despite their relatively small effective population size (Ne), is unclear. In animals, the population genetics of codon usage bias has only been studied in a handful of model organisms so far, and can be affected by confounding, nonadaptive processes such as GC-biased gene conversion and experimental artefacts. Using population transcriptomics data, we analyzed the relationship between codon usage, gene expression, allele frequency distribution, and recombination rate in 30 nonmodel species of animals, each from a different family, covering a wide range of effective population sizes. We disentangled the effects of translational selection and GC-biased gene conversion on codon usage by separately analyzing GC-conservative and GC-changing mutations. We report evidence for effective translational selection on codon usage in large-Ne species of animals, but not in small-Ne ones, in agreement with the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. C- and T-ending codons tend to be preferred over synonymous G- and A-ending ones, for reasons that remain to be determined. In contrast, we uncovered a conspicuous effect of GC-biased gene conversion, which is widespread in animals and the main force determining the fate of AT↔GC mutations. Intriguingly, the strength of its effect was uncorrelated with Ne.},

There exists a strong positive correlation between codon usage and tRNA content in both organisms, and the extent of this correlation relates to the protein production levels of individual genes. Codon-choice patterns are believed to have been well conserved during the course of evolution. Examination of silent substitutions and tRNA populations in Enterobacteriaceae revealed that the evolutionary constraint imposed by tRNA content on codon usage decelerated rather than accelerated the silent-substitution rate, at least insofar as pairs of taxonomically related organisms were examined. Codon-choice patterns of multicellular organisms are briefly reviewed, and diversity in G+C percentage at the third position of codons in vertebrate genes--as well as a possible causative factor in the production of this diversity--is discussed.},

By examining codon usage bias across codons, genes, and genomes of 327 species in the budding yeast subphylum, we show that synonymous codon usage is shaped by both neutral processes and selection for translational efficiency. Specifically, whereas codon usage bias for most codons appears to be strongly associated with mutational bias and largely driven by genetic drift across the entire subphylum, patterns of codon usage bias in a few codons, as well as in many genes in nearly all genomes of budding yeasts, deviate from neutral expectations. Rather, the synonymous codons used within genes in most budding yeast genomes are adapted to the tRNAs present within each genome, a result most likely due to translational selection that optimizes codons to match the tRNAs. Our results suggest that patterns of codon usage bias in budding yeasts, and perhaps more broadly in fungi and other microbial eukaryotes, are shaped by both neutral and selective processes.},

This fact has motivated extensive efforts to measure the DFE or to predict it from first principles. However, just as the DFE determines the course of evolution, the evolutionary process itself constrains the DFE. Here, we analyze a simple model of genome evolution in a constant environment in which natural selection drives the population toward a dynamic steady state where beneficial and deleterious substitutions balance. The distribution of fitness effects at this steady state is stable under further evolution and provides a natural null expectation for the DFE in a population that has evolved in a constant environment for a long time. We calculate how the shape of the evolutionarily stable DFE depends on the underlying population genetic parameters. We show that, in the absence of epistasis, the ratio of beneficial to deleterious mutations of a given fitness effect obeys a simple relationship independent of population genetic details. Finally, we analyze how the stable DFE changes in the presence of a simple form of diminishing-returns epistasis.},

@article{Gillespie84,
	Abstract = {{$[$}A model of molecular evolution by natural selection is described. The dynamics of the model are determined to a great extent by the nature of the mutational process of DNA. This is due to the very low nucleotide mutation rate that effectively limits natural selection to those alleles that differ from the currently fixed allele by a single nucleotide. As a consequence, it is shown that evolution should proceed in a series of bursts if natural selection is the main mechanism for the change. A typical burst of evolution is shown to involve about 1.5 to 2.5 allelic substitutions on average. One consequence of these bursts is to elevate the variance to mean ratio in the number of substitutions per unit time to a level as is commonly observed in the protein evolution data. These results appears to be very robust to many of the particulars of the model because of the role played by extreme value theory in determining the fitnesses of the alleles.{$]$}},

A fundamental goal in systems biology is to understand how cellular behavior emerges from the interaction in time and space of genetically encoded molecular parts, as well as nongenetically encoded small molecules. Networks provide a natural framework for the organization and quantitative representation of all the available data about molecular interactions. The structural and dynamic properties of molecular networks have been the subject of intense research. Despite major advances, bridging network structure to dynamics---and therefore to behavior---remains challenging. A key concept of modern engineering that recurs in the functional analysis of biological networks is modularity. Most approaches to molecular network analysis rely to some extent on the assumption that molecular networks are modular---that is, they are separable and can be studied to some degree in isolation. We describe recent advances in the analysis of modularity in biological networks, focusing on the increasing realization that a dynamic perspective is essential to grouping molecules into modules and determining their collective function.},

Here, we studied system-level epistatic interactions by computing growth phenotypes of all single and double knockouts of 890 metabolic genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using the framework of flux balance analysis4. A new scale for epistasis identified a distinctive trimodal distribution of these epistatic effects, allowing gene pairs to be classified as buffering, aggravating or noninteracting2,5. We found that the ensuing epistatic interaction network6 could be organized hierarchically into function-enriched modules that interact with each other 'monochromatically' (i.e., with purely aggravating or purely buffering epistatic links). This property extends the concept of epistasis from single genes to functional units and provides a new definition of biological modularity, which emphasizes interactions between, rather than within, functional modules. Our approach can be used to infer functional gene modules from purely phenotypic epistasis measurements.},

	Abstract = {Historically, one of the most controversial aspects of Darwinian evolution has been the prominent role that randomness and random change play in it. Most biologists agree that mutations in DNA have random effects on fitness. However, fitness is a highly simplified scalar representation of an enormously complex phenotype. Challenges to Darwinian thinking have focused on such complex phenotypes. Whether mutations affect such complex phenotypes randomly is ill understood. Here I discuss three very different classes of well-studied molecular phenotypes in which mutations cause nonrandom changes, based on our current knowledge. What is more, this nonrandomness facilitates evolutionary adaptation. Thus, living beings may translate DNA change into nonrandom phenotypic change that facilitates Darwinian evolution.},

They can roughly be divided into mechanistic models (e.g., metabolic networks) and more heuristic models like Fisher's geometrical model. Each has its own drawbacks, but both yield testable predictions on how the context (genomic background or environment) affects the distribution of mutation effects on fitness and thus adaptation. Both have received some empirical validation. This article aims at bridging the gap between these approaches. A derivation of the Fisher model ``from first principles''is proposed, where the basic assumptions emerge from a more general model, inspired by mechanistic networks. I start from a general phenotypic network relating unspecified phenotypic traits and fitness. A limited set of qualitative assumptions is then imposed, mostly corresponding to known features of phenotypic networks: a large set of traits is pleiotropically affected by mutations and determines a much smaller set of traits under optimizing selection. Otherwise, the model remains fairly general regarding the phenotypic processes involved or the distribution of mutation effects affecting the network. A statistical treatment and a local approximation close to a fitness optimum yield a landscape that is effectively the isotropic Fisher model or its extension with a single dominant phenotypic direction. The fit of the resulting alternative distributions is illustrated in an empirical data set. These results bear implications on the validity of Fisher's model's assumptions and on which features of mutation fitness effects may vary (or not) across genomic or environmental contexts.},

	Abstract = {How do the fitness effects of several mutations combine? Despite its simplicity, this question is central to the understanding of multilocus evolution. Epistasis (the interaction between alleles at different loci), especially epistasis for fitness traits such as reproduction and survival, influences evolutionary predictions1,2 ``almost whenever multilocus genetics matters''3. Yet very few models4,5 have sought to predict epistasis, and none has been empirically tested. Here we show that the distribution of epistasis can be predicted from the distribution of single mutation effects, based on a simple fitness landscape model6. We show that this prediction closely matches the empirical measures of epistasis that have been obtained for Escherichia coli7 and the RNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus8. Our results suggest that a simple fitness landscape model may be sufficient to quantitatively capture the complex nature of gene interactions. This model may offer a simple and widely applicable alternative to complex metabolic network models, in particular for making evolutionary predictions.},

Indeed, we can make no theoretical predictions, however heuristic, about the distribution of phenotypic effects among factors fixed during adaptation nor about the expected ?size? of the largest factor fixed. Study of this problem requires taking into account that populations gradually approach a phenotypic optimum during adaptation via the stepwise substitution of favorable mutations. Using Fisher's geometric model of adaptation, I analyze this approach to the optimum, and derive an approximate solution to the size distribution of factors fixed during adaptation. I further generalize these results to allow the input of any distribution of mutational effects. The distribution of factors fixed during adaptation assumes a pleasingly simple, exponential form. This result is remarkably insensitive to changes in the fitness function and in the distribution of mutational effects. An exponential trend among factors fixed appears to be a general property of adaptation toward a fixed optimum.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations plays a fundamental role in evolutionary genetics. However, the extent to which the DFE differs across species has yet to be systematically investigated. Furthermore, the biological mechanisms determining the DFE in natural populations remain unclear. Here, we show that theoretical models emphasizing different biological factors at determining the DFE, such as protein stability, back-mutations, species complexity, and mutational robustness make distinct predictions about how the DFE will differ between species. Analyzing amino acid-changing variants from natural populations in a comparative population genomic framework, we find that humans have a higher proportion of strongly deleterious mutations than Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, when comparing the DFE across yeast, Drosophila, mice, and humans, the average selection coefficient becomes more deleterious with increasing species complexity. Last, pleiotropic genes have a DFE that is less variable than that of nonpleiotropic genes. Comparing four categories of theoretical models, only Fisher's geometrical model (FGM) is consistent with our findings. FGM assumes that multiple phenotypes are under stabilizing selection, with the number of phenotypes defining the complexity of the organism. Our results suggest that long-term population size and cost of complexity drive the evolution of the DFE, with many implications for evolutionary and medical genomics.},

@article{Le-Nagard11,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence of organismal complexity has been a difficult subject for researchers because it is not readily amenable to investigation by experimental approaches. Complexity has a myriad of untested definitions and our understanding of its evolution comes primarily from static snapshots gleaned from organisms ranked on an intuitive scale. Fisher's geometric model of adaptation, which defines complexity as the number of phenotypes an organism exposes to natural selection, provides a theoretical framework to study complexity. Yet investigations of this model reveal phenotypic complexity as costly and therefore unlikely to emerge. RESULTS: We have developed a computational approach to study the emergence of complexity by subjecting neural networks to adaptive evolution in environments exacting different levels of demands. We monitored complexity by a variety of metrics. Top down metrics derived from Fisher's geometric model correlated better with the environmental demands than bottom up ones such as network size. Phenotypic complexity was found to increase towards an environment-dependent level through the emergence of restricted pleiotropy. Such pleiotropy, which confined the action of mutations to only a subset of traits, better tuned phenotypes in challenging environments. However, restricted pleiotropy also came at a cost in the form of a higher genetic load, as it required the maintenance by natural selection of more independent traits. Consequently, networks of different sizes converged in complexity when facing similar environment. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic complexity evolved as a function of the demands of the selective pressures, rather than the physical properties of the network architecture, such as functional size. Our results show that complexity may be more predictable, and understandable, if analyzed from the perspective of the integrated task the organism performs, rather than the physical architecture used to accomplish such tasks. Thus, top down metrics emphasizing selection may be better for describing biological complexity than bottom up ones representing size and other physical attributes.},

As knowledge of biological systems has increased, it has become apparent that these metrics are often incongruent. Methodology Here we propose an alternative complexity metric based on the number of genetically uncorrelated phenotypic traits contributing to an organism's fitness. This metric, phenotypic complexity, is more objective than previous suggestions, as complexity is measured from a fundamental biological perspective, that of natural selection. We utilize a model linking the equilibrium fitness (drift load) of a population to phenotypic complexity. We then use results from viral evolution experiments to compare the phenotypic complexities of two viruses, the bacteriophage X174 and vesicular stomatitis virus, and to illustrate the consistency of our approach and its applicability. Conclusions/Significance Because Darwinian evolution through natural selection is the fundamental element unifying all biological organisms, we propose that our metric of complexity is potentially a more relevant metric than others, based on the count of artificially defined set of objects.},

@article{Martin06,
	Abstract = {The evolution of complex organisms is a puzzle for evolutionary theory because beneficial mutations should be less frequent in complex organisms, an effect termed "cost of complexity." However, little is known about how the distribution of mutation fitness effects (f(s)) varies across genomes. The main theoretical framework to address this issue is Fisher's geometric model and related phenotypic landscape models. However, it suffers from several restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we intend to show how several of these limitations may be overcome. We then propose a model of f(s) that extends Fisher's model to account for arbitrary mutational and selective interactions among n traits. We show that these interactions result in f(s) that would be predicted by a much smaller number of independent traits. We test our predictions by comparing empirical f(s) across species of various gene numbers as a surrogate to complexity. This survey reveals, as predicted, that mutations tend to be more deleterious, less variable, and less skewed in higher organisms. However, only limited difference in the shape of f(s) is observed from Escherichia coli to nematodes or fruit flies, a pattern consistent with a model of random phenotypic interactions across many traits. Overall, these results suggest that there may be a cost to phenotypic complexity although much weaker than previously suggested by earlier theoretical works. More generally, the model seems to qualitatively capture and possibly explain the variation of f(s) from lower to higher organisms, which opens a large array of potential applications in evolutionary genetics.},

	Abstract = {Adaptation is characterized by the movement of a population toward a many-character optimum, movement that results in an increase in fitness. Here I calculate the rate at which fitness increases during adaptation and describe the curve giving fitness versus time as a population approaches an optimum in Fisher's model of adaptation. The results identify several factors affecting the speed of adaptation. One of the most important is organismal complexity--complex organisms adapt more slowly than simple ones when using mutations of the same phenotypic size. Thus, as Fisher foresaw, organisms pay a kind of cost of complexity. However, the magnitude of this cost is considerably larger than Fisher's analysis suggested. Indeed the rate of adaptation declines at least as fast as n-1, where n is the number of independent characters or dimensions comprising an organism. The present results also suggest that one can define an effective number of dimensions characterizing an adapting species.},

	Abstract = {Fisher's geometric model has been widely used to study the effects of pleiotropy and organismic complexity on phenotypic adaptation. Here, we study a version of Fisher's model in which a population adapts to a gradually moving optimum. Key parameters are the rate of environmental change, the dimensionality of phenotype space, and the patterns of mutational and selectional correlations. We focus on the distribution of adaptive substitutions, that is, the multivariate distribution of the phenotypic effects of fixed beneficial mutations. Our main results are based on an "adaptive-walk approximation," which is checked against individual-based simulations. We find that (1) the distribution of adaptive substitutions is strongly affected by the ecological dynamics and largely depends on a single composite parameter γ, which scales the rate of environmental change by the "adaptive potential" of the population; (2) the distribution of adaptive substitution reflects the shape of the fitness landscape if the environment changes slowly, whereas it mirrors the distribution of new mutations if the environment changes fast; (3) in contrast to classical models of adaptation assuming a constant optimum, with a moving optimum, more complex organisms evolve via larger adaptive steps.},

	N2 = {The replacement of the blending by the particulate theory of inheritance has removed the necessity for postulating mechanisms for the extensive origination and control of mutations, since on the latter theory as compared to the former the random decay of variability (the raw material of evolution) is insignificant; the strategic point in evolutionary control is therefore in natural selection rather than mutation. The rate of increase of fitness to survive (as measured by survival) is equal to the genetic component of the variance; the larger the change introduced by a mutant, or the closer the adaptation, the smaller will be the chance of improvement; changes in the environment must also be taken into account. Dominance is regarded as having arisen from the selective influence of modifying factors. Mutant genes which are not wiped out fortuitously or by adverse selection within the first few generations have an excellent chance of establishing themselves, even with very small advantages and low mutation rates. Sexual selection may be of great importance, under favorable circumstances, in aiding the fission of species. Mimicry provides an especially instructive example of complex adaptation. In man differential fertility is the principal menace to the species, and appears to be due to (1) the inheritance of fertility, and (2) the social promotion of the infertile; it could be controlled by rather moderate social changes.

However, these two factors are traditionally investigated by disciplines with different emphasis and philosophy-molecular biophysics on one hand and evolutionary population genetics in another. Here, we review recent theoretical and computational approaches that address the crucial need to integrate these two disciplines. We first articulate the elements of these approaches. Then, we survey their contribution to our mechanistic understanding of molecular evolution, the polymorphisms in coding region, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations, the observed folding stability of proteins in nature, and the distribution of protein folds in genomes.},

Modularity has emerged as a rallying point for research in developmental and evolutionary biology (and specifically evo-devo), as well as in molecular systems biology.

Others are preserved because the heterozygous form is fitter than either homozygote. In the former case the loss of fitness in the species is roughly equal to the sum of all mutation rates and is probably of the order of 5 per cent. It is suggested that this loss of fitness is the price paid by a species for its capacity for further evolution.},

The ecological effects of load are not clear-cut because some conditions (such as selection early in life, sexual selection, reproductive compensation, and intraspecific competition) reduce the effects of load on population size and persistence, but other conditions (such as interspecific competition and load on resource use efficiency) can cause small amounts of load to have strong effects on the population, even extinction.

The model allows us to study the general properties of molecular species undergoing neutral evolution. We find that a number of phenomena seen in RNA sequence-structure maps are present also in our general model. Examples are the occurrence of 'common' structures that occupy a fraction of the genotype space which tends to unity as the length of the genotype increases, and the formation of percolating neutral networks that cover the genotype space in such a way that a member of such a network can be found within a small radius of any point in the space. We also describe a number of new phenomena that appear to be general properties of systems possessing selective neutrality. In particular, we show that the maximum fitness attained during the adaptive walk of a population evolving on such a fitness landscape increases with increasing degree of neutrality, and is directly related to the fitness of the most fit percolating network.},

	Abstract = {Recent research in molecular evolution has raised awareness of the importance of selective neutrality. Several different models of neutrality have been proposed based on Kauffman's well-known NK landscape model. Two of these models, NKp and NKq, are investigated and found to display significantly different structural properties. The fitness distributions of these neutral landscapes reveal that their levels of correlation with non-neutral landscapes are significantly different, as are the distributions of neutral mutations. In this paper we describe a series of simulations of a hill climbing search algorithm on NK, NKp and NKq landscapes with varying levels of epistatic interaction. These simulations demonstrate differences in the way that epistatic interaction affects the 'searchability' of neutral landscapes. We conclude that the method used to implement neutrality has an impact on both the structure of the resulting landscapes and on the performance of evolutionary search algorithms on these landscapes. These model-dependent effects must be taken into consideration when modelling biological phenomena.},

	N2 = {Evolution in variable environments depends crucially on the fates of new mutations in the face of fluctuating selection pressures. In constant environments, the relationship between the selective effect of a mutation and the probability that it will eventually fix or go extinct is well understood. However, our understanding of fixation probabilities in fluctuating environmental conditions is limited. Here, we show that temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions can have dramatic effects on the fate of each new mutation, reducing the efficiency of natural selection and increasing the fixation probability of all mutations, including those that are strongly deleterious on average. This makes it difficult for a population to maintain specialist adaptations, even if their benefits outweigh their costs.Natural environments are never truly constant, but the evolutionary implications of temporally varying selection pressures remain poorly understood. Here we investigate how the fate of a new mutation in a fluctuating environment depends on the dynamics of environmental variation and on the selective pressures in each condition. We find that even when a mutation experiences many environmental epochs before fixing or going extinct, its fate is not necessarily determined by its time-averaged selective effect. Instead, environmental variability reduces the efficiency of selection across a broad parameter regime, rendering selection unable to distinguish between mutations that are substantially beneficial and substantially deleterious on average. Temporal fluctuations can also dramatically increase fixation probabilities, often making the details of these fluctuations more important than the average selection pressures acting on each new mutation. For example, mutations that result in a trade-off between conditions but are strongly deleterious on average can nevertheless be more likely to fix than mutations that are always neutral or beneficial. These effects can have important implications for patterns of molecular evolution in variable environments, and they suggest that it may often be difficult for populations to maintain specialist traits, even when their loss leads to a decline in time-averaged fitness.},

@article{Iwasa04b,
	Abstract = {We study a situation that arises in the somatic evolution of cancer. Consider a finite population of replicating cells and a sequence of mutations: type 0 can mutate to type 1, which can mutate to type 2. There is no back mutation. We start with a homogeneous population of type 0. Mutants of type 1 emerge and either become extinct or reach fixation. In both cases, they can generate type 2, which also can become extinct or reach fixation. If mutation rates are small compared to the inverse of the population size, then the stochastic dynamics can be described by transitions between homogeneous populations. A "stochastic tunnel" arises, when the population moves from all 0 to all 2 without ever being all 1. We calculate the exact rate of stochastic tunneling for the case when type 1 is as fit as type 0 or less fit. Type 2 has the highest fitness. We discuss implications for the elimination of tumor suppressor genes and the activation of genetic instability. Although our theory is developed for cancer genetics, stochastic tunnels are general phenomena that could arise in many circumstances.},

@article{Guo19,
	Abstract = {Adaptation, where a population evolves increasing fitness in a fixed environment, is typically thought of as a hill-climbing process on a fitness landscape. With a finite genome, such a process eventually leads the population to a fitness peak, at which point fitness can no longer increase through individual beneficial mutations. Instead, the ruggedness of typical landscapes due to epistasis between genes or DNA sites suggests that the accumulation of multiple mutations (via a process known as stochastic tunneling) can allow a population to continue increasing in fitness. However, it is not clear how such a phenomenon would affect long-term fitness evolution. By using a spin-glass type model for the fitness function that takes into account microscopic epistasis, we find that hopping between metastable states can mechanistically and robustly give rise to a slow, logarithmic average fitness trajectory.},

@article{Kauffman87,
	Abstract = {Adaptive evolution, to a large extent, is a complex combinatorial optimization process. In this article we take beginning steps towards developing a general theory of adaptive ``walks''via fitter variants in such optimization processes. We introduce the basic idea of a space of entities, each a 1-mutant neighbor of many other entities in the space, and the idea of a fitness ascribed to each entity. Adaptive walks proceed from an initial entity, via fitter neighbors, to locally or globally optimal entities that are fitter than their neighbors. We develop a general theory for the number of local optima, lengths of adaptive walks, and the number of alternative local optima accessible from any given initial entity, for the baseline case of an uncorrelated fitness landscape. Most fitness landscapes are correlated, however. Therefore we develop parts of a universal theory of adaptation on correlated landscapes by adaptive processes that have sufficient numbers of mutations per individual to ``jump beyond''the correlation lengths in the underlying landscape. In addition, we explore the statistical character of adaptive walks in two independent complex combinatorial optimization problems, that of evolving a specific cell type in model genetic networks, and that of finding good solutions to the traveling salesman problem. Surprisingly, both show similar statistical features, encouraging the hope that a general theory for adaptive walks on correlated and uncorrelated landscapes can be found. In the final section we explore two limits to the efficacy of selection. The first is new, and surprising: for a wide class of systems, as the complexity of the entities under selection increases, the local optima that are attainable fall progressively closer to the mean properties of the underlying space of entities. This may imply that complex biological systems, such as genetic regulatory systems, are ``close''to the mean properties of the ensemble of genomic regulatory systems explored by evolution. The second limit shows that with increasing complexity and a fixed mutation rate, selection often becomes unable to pull an adapting population to those local optima to which connected adaptive walks via fitter variants exist. These beginning steps in theory development are applied to maturation of the immune response, and to the problem of radiation and stasis. Despite the limitations of the adaptive landscape metaphor, we believe that further development along the lines begun here will prove useful.},

@article{Kauffman89,
	Abstract = {Adaptive evolution is, to a large extent, a complex combinatorial optimization process. Such processes can be characterized as ``uphill walks on rugged fitness landscapes''. Concrete examples of fitness landscapes include the distribution of any specific functional property such as the capacity to catalyze a specific reaction, or bind a specific ligand, in ``protein space''. In particular, the property might be the affinity of all possible antibody molecules for a specific antigenic determinant. That affinity landscape presumably plays a critical role in maturation of the immune response. In this process, hypermutation and clonal selection act to select antibody V region mutant variants with successively higher affinity for the immunizing antigen. The actual statistical structure of affinity landscapes, although knowable, is currently unknown. Here, we analyze a class of mathematical models we call NK models. We show that these models capture significant features of the maturation of the immune response, which is currently thought to share features with general protein evolution. The NK models have the important property that, as the parameter K increases, the ``ruggedness''of the NK landscape varies from a single peaked ``Fujiyama''landscape to a multi-peaked ``badlands''landscape. Walks to local optima on such landscapes become shorter as K increases. This fact allows us to choose a value of K that corresponds to the experimentally observed number of mutational ``steps'', 6--8, taken as an antibody sequence matures. If the mature antibody is taken to correspond to a local optimum in the model, tuning the model requires that K be about 40, implying that the functional contribution of each amino acid in the V region is affected by about 40 others. Given this value of K, the model then predicts several features of ``antibody space''that are in qualitative agreement with experiment: (1) The fraction of fitter variants of an initial ``roughed in''germ line antibody amplified by clonal selection is about 1--2{\%}. (2) Mutations at some sites of the mature antibody hardly affect antibody function at all, but mutations at other sites dramatically decrease function. (3) The same ``roughed in''antibody sequence can ``walk''to many mature antibody sequences. (4) Many adaptive walks can end on the same local optimum. (5) Comparison of different mature sequences derived from the same initial V region shows evolutionary hot spots and parallel mutations. All these predictions are open to detailed testing by obtaining monoclonal antibodies early in the immune response and carrying out in vitro mutagenesis and adaptive hill climbing with respect to affinity for the immunizing antigen.},

	Abstract = {Having multiple peaks within fitness landscapes critically affects the course of evolution, but whether their presence imposes specific requirements at the level of genetic interactions remains unestablished. Here we show that to exhibit multiple fitness peaks, a biological system must contain reciprocal sign epistatic interactions, which are defined as genetic changes that are separately unfavorable but jointly advantageous. Using Morse theory, we argue that it is impossible to formulate a sufficient condition for multiple peaks in terms of local genetic interactions. These findings indicate that systems incapable of reciprocal sign epistasis will always possess a single fitness peak. However, reciprocal sign epistasis should be pervasive in nature as it is a logical consequence of specificity in molecular interactions. The results thus predict that specific molecular interactions may yield multiple fitness peaks, which can be tested experimentally.},

We used experimental evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to quantify this contingency, finding differences in adaptability among 64 closely related genotypes. Despite these differences, sequencing of 104 evolved clones showed that initial genotype did not constrain future mutational trajectories. Instead, reconstructed combinations of mutations revealed a pattern of diminishing-returns epistasis: Beneficial mutations have consistently smaller effects in fitter backgrounds. Taken together, these results show that beneficial mutations affecting a variety of biological processes are globally coupled; they interact strongly, but only through their combined effect on fitness. As a consequence, fitness evolution follows a predictable trajectory even though sequence-level adaptation is stochastic.},

	N2 = {Author summary The effects of mutations often depend on the presence or absence of other mutations. This phenomenon, known as epistasis, has been used extensively to infer functional associations between genes. For example, genes that participate in the same functional module will often show a characteristic pattern of positive epistasis where the knockout of one gene will mask the deleterious effects of knockouts in the other genes. In the context of adaptation, epistasis can cause the outcomes of evolution to depend strongly on the initial genotype. Although studies have found that epistasis is common in laboratory populations, we do not know the extent to which the patterns of epistasis that reveal functional associations overlap with the patterns of epistasis that are important in evolution. Here, by comparing evolution in strains with gene deletions in different functional modules, we quantify the effect of functional epistasis on evolutionary outcomes. We find that mutants with deletions in the same module have more similar evolutionary outcomes, on average, than mutants with deletions in different modules. This suggests that screens for epistasis between gene deletion mutations will not only reveal functional interactions between those genes but may also predict evolutionary dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The effect of a mutation on the organism often depends on what other mutations are already present in its genome. Geneticists refer to such mutational interactions as epistasis. Pairwise epistatic effects have been recognized for over a century, and their evolutionary implications have received theoretical attention for nearly as long. However, pairwise epistatic interactions themselves can vary with genomic background. This is called higher-order epistasis, and its consequences for evolution are much less well understood. Here, we assess the influence that higher-order epistasis has on the topography of 16 published, biological fitness landscapes. We find that on average, their effects on fitness landscape declines with order, and suggest that notable exceptions to this trend may deserve experimental scrutiny. We conclude by highlighting opportunities for further theoretical and experimental work dissecting the influence that epistasis of all orders has on fitness landscape topography and on the efficiency of evolution by natural selection.},

@article{Weinreich05b,
	Abstract = {Epistasis for fitness means that the selective effect of a mutation is conditional on the genetic background in which it appears. Although epistasis is widely observed in nature, our understanding of its consequences for evolution by natural selection remains incomplete. In particular, much attention focuses only on its influence on the instantaneous rate of changes in frequency of selected alleles via epistatic contribution to the additive genetic variance for fitness. Thus, in this framework epistasis only has evolutionary importance if the interacting loci are simultaneously segregating in the population. However, the selective accessibility of mutational trajectories to high fitness genotypes may depend on the genetic background in which novel mutations appear, and this effect is independent of population polymorphism at other loci. Here we explore this second influence of epistasis on evolution by natural selection. We show that it is the consequence of a particular form of epistasis, which we designate sign epistasis. Sign epistasis means that the sign of the fitness effect of a mutation is under epistatic control; thus, such a mutation is beneficial on some genetic backgrounds and deleterious on others. Recent experimental innovations in microbial systems now permit assessment of the fitness effects of individual mutations on multiple genetic backgrounds. We review this literature and identify many examples of sign epistasis, and we suggest that the implications of these results may generalize to other organisms. These theoretical and empirical considerations imply that strong genetic constraint on the selective accessibility of trajectories to high fitness genotypes may exist and suggest specific areas of investigation for future research.},

Using extreme value theory, I derive this distribution and show that it has two unexpected properties. First, the distribution of beneficial fitness effects at a gene is exponential. Second, the distribution of beneficial effects at a gene has the same mean regardless of the fitness of the present wild-type allele. Adaptation from new mutations is thus characterized by a kind of invariance: natural selection chooses from the same spectrum of beneficial effects at a locus independent of the fitness rank of the present wild type. I show that these findings are reasonably robust to deviations from several assumptions. I further show that one can back calculate the mean size of new beneficial mutations from the observed mean size of fixed beneficial mutations.},

@article{Hartl96,
	Abstract = {One implication of Kacser's analysis of complex metabolic systems is that mutations with small effects exist as a consequence of the typically small flux control coefficient relating enzyme activity to the rate of a metabolic process. Although a slightly detrimental mutation is somewhat less likely to become fixed by chance than a slightly favorable mutation, mutations that are slightly detrimental might be expected to be more numerous than favorable mutations owing to the previous incorporation of favorable mutations by a long history of natural selection. The result is that, as Ohta has pointed out, a significant fraction of mutations that are fixed in evolution are slightly detrimental. In the long run, the fixation of detrimental mutations in a gene increases the opportunity for the occurrence of a compensatory favorable mutation, either in the same gene or in an interacting gene. On a suitably long timescale, therefore, every gene incorporates favorable mutations that compensate for detrimental mutations previously fixed. This form of evolution is driven primarily by natural selection, but it results in no change or permanent improvement in enzymatic function.},

Among these models, Fisher Geometric Model (FGM) has received a lot of attention over the last two decades. FGM is based on a continuous multidimensional phenotypic landscape, but it is for the emerging properties of individual mutation effects that it is mostly used. Despite an apparent simplicity and a limited number of parameters, FGM integrates a full model of mutation and epistatic interactions that allows the study of both beneficial and deleterious mutations, and subsequently the fate of evolving populations.

@article{Keightley07,
	Abstract = {The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations (DFE) is important for addressing several questions in genetics, including the nature of quantitative variation and the evolutionary fate of small populations. Properties of the DFE can be inferred by comparing the distributions of the frequencies of segregating nucleotide polymorphisms at selected and neutral sites in a population sample, but demographic changes alter the spectrum of allele frequencies at both neutral and selected sites, so can bias estimates of the DFE if not accounted for. We have developed a maximum-likelihood approach, based on the expected allele-frequency distribution generated by transition matrix methods, to estimate parameters of the DFE while simultaneously estimating parameters of a demographic model that allows a population size change at some time in the past. We tested the method using simulations and found that it accurately recovers simulated parameter values, even if the simulated demography differs substantially from that assumed in our analysis. We use our method to estimate parameters of the DFE for amino acid-changing mutations in humans and Drosophila melanogaster. For a model of unconditionally deleterious mutations, with effects sampled from a gamma distribution, the mean estimate for the distribution shape parameter is approximately 0.2 for human populations, which implies that the DFE is strongly leptokurtic. For Drosophila populations, we estimate that the shape parameter is approximately 0.35. Differences in the shape of the distribution and the mean selection coefficient between humans and Drosophila result in significantly more strongly deleterious mutations in Drosophila than in humans, and, conversely, nearly neutral mutations are significantly less frequent.},

We estimated U and sh (the heterozygous effect of mutations) for two diploid yeast strains differing only in the DNA mismatch-repair deficiency used to elevate the mutation rate in one (mutator) strain. Mutations were allowed to accumulate in 50 replicate lines of each strain, during 36 transfers of randomly chosen single colonies (approximately 600 generations). Among wild-type lines, fitnesses were bimodal, with one mode showing no change in mean fitness. The other mode showed a mean 29.6{\%} fitness decline and the petite phenotype, usually caused by partial deletion of the mitochondrial genome. Excluding petites, maximum-likelihood estimates adjusted for the effect of selection were U = 9.5 x 10(-5) and sh = 0.217 for the wild type. Among the mutator lines, the best fit was obtained with 0.005 < or = U < or = 0.94 and 0.049 > or = sh > or = 0.0003. Like other recently tested model organisms, wild-type yeast have low mutation rates, with high mean fitness costs per mutation.

	N2 = {One of the assumptions underlying many theoretical predictions in evolutionary biology concerns the distribution of the fitness effect of mutations. Approximations to this distribution have been derived using various theoretical approaches, of which Fisher's geometrical model is among the most popular ones. Two key concepts in this model are complexity and pleiotropy. Recent studies have proposed different methods for estimating how complexity varies across species, but their results have been contradictory. Here, we show that contradictory results are to be expected when the assumption of universal pleiotropy is violated. We develop a model in which the two key parameters are the total number of traits and the mean number of traits affected by a single mutation. We derive approximations for the distribution of the fitness effect of mutations when populations are either well-adapted or away from the optimum. We also consider drift load in a well-adapted population and show that it is independent of the distribution of the fitness effect of mutations. We show that mutation accumulation experiments can only measure the effect of the mean number of traits affected by mutations, whereas drift load only provides information about the total number of traits. We discuss the plausibility of the model.},

	N2 = {Abstract We have investigated the reduction of fitness caused by the fixation of new deleterious mutations in small populations within the framework of Fisher's geometrical model of adaptation. In Fisher's model, a population evolves in an n-dimensional character space with an adaptive optimum at the origin. The model allows us to investigate compensatory mutations, which restore fitness losses incurred by other mutations, in a context-dependent manner. We have conducted a moment analysis of the model, supplemented by the numerical results of computer simulations. The mean reduction of fitness (i.e., expected load) scaled to one is approximately n/(n + 2Ne), where Ne is the effective population size. The reciprocal relationship between the load and Ne implies that the fixation of deleterious mutations is unlikely to cause extinction when there is a broad scope for compensatory mutations, except in very small populations. Furthermore, the dependence of load on n implies that pleiotropy plays a large role in determining the extinction risk of small populations. Differences and similarities between our results and those of a previous study on the effects of Ne and n are explored. That the predictions of this model are qualitatively different from studies ignoring compensatory mutations implies that we must be cautious in predicting the evolutionary fate of small populations and that additional data on the nature of mutations is of critical importance.},

	N2 = {Recent theoretical studies have illustrated the potential role of spontaneous deleterious mutation as a cause of extinction in small populations. However, these studies have not addressed several genetic issues, which can in principle have a substantial influence on the risk of extinction. These include the presence of synergistic epistasis, which can reduce the rate of mutation accumulation by progressively magnifying the selective effects of mutations, and the occurrence of beneficial mutations, which can offset the effects of previous deleterious mutations. In stochastic simulations of small populations (effective sizes on the order of 100 or less), we show that both synergistic epistasis and the rate of beneficial mutation must be unrealistically high to substantially reduce the risk of extinction due to random fixation of deleterious mutations. However, in analytical calculations based on diffusion theory, we show that in large, outcrossing populations (effective sizes greater than a few hundred), very low levels of beneficial mutation are sufficient to prevent mutational decay. Further simulation results indicate that in populations small enough to be highly vulnerable to mutational decay, variance in deleterious mutational effects reduces the risk of extinction, assuming that the mean deleterious mutational effect is on the order of a few percent or less. We also examine the magnitude of outcrossing that is necessary to liberate a predominantly selfing population from the threat of long-term mutational deterioration. The critical amount of outcrossing appears to be greater than is common in near-obligately selfing plant species, supporting the contention that such species are generally doomed to extinction via random drift of new mutations. Our results support the hypothesis that a long-term effective population size in the neighborhood of a few hundred individuals defines an approximate threshold, below which outcrossing populations are vulnerable to extinction via fixation of deleterious mutations, and above which immunity is acquired.},

If these alleles have independent effects on fitness, previous analysis suggested that the rate of this decrease either remains constant or, if accumulation of mutations leads to the decline of the population size, grows. Here I show that this conclusion is quite sensitive to the assumption of independence. If deleterious alleles have synergistic fitness effects, then, as the ratchet advances, the frequency of the best available genotype will necessarily increase, making its loss less and less probable. As a result, sufficiently strong synergistic epistasis can effectively halt the action of Muller's ratchet. Instead of being driven extinct, a finite asexual population could then survive practically indefinitely, although with lower mean fitness than without random drift.},

The impact of drift on genome diversity and evolution is known to vary among species, but quantifying this effect is a difficult task. Here we assess the magnitude of variation in drift power among species of animals via its effect on the mutation load --which implies also inferring the distribution of fitness effects of deleterious mutations. To this aim, we analyze the nonsynonymous (amino-acid changing) and synonymous (amino-acid conservative) allele frequency spectra in a large sample of metazoan species, with a focus on the primates vs. fruit flies contrast. We show that a Gamma model of the distribution of fitness effects is not suitable due to strong differences in estimated shape parameters among taxa, while adding a class of lethal mutations essentially solves the problem. Using the Gamma + lethal model and assuming that the mean deleterious effects of nonsynonymous mutations is shared among species, we estimate that the power of drift varies by a factor of at least 500 between large-Ne and small-Ne species of animals, i.e., an order of magnitude more than the among-species variation in genetic diversity. Our results are relevant to Lewontin's paradox while further questioning the meaning of the Ne parameter in population genomics.},

The frequency of mutation is generally small, but it seems probable that it can sometimes be increased by changes in the environment (1,2). On the whole mutants recessive to the normal type occur more commonly than dominants. The frequency of a given type of mutation varies, but for some factors in Drosophila it must be less than 10−6, and is much less in some human cases. We shall first consider initial conditions, when only a few of the new type exist as the result of a single mutation; and then the course of events in a population where the new factor is present in such numbers as to be in no danger of extinction by mere bad luck.

	Abstract = {Many models of evolution calculate the rate of evolution by multiplying the rate at which new mutations originate within a population by a probability of fixation. Here we review the historical origins, contemporary applications, and evolutionary implications of these "origin-fixation" models, which are widely used in evolutionary genetics, molecular evolution, and phylogenetics. Origin-fixation models were first introduced in 1969, in association with an emerging view of "molecular" evolution. Early origin-fixation models were used to calculate an instantaneous rate of evolution across a large number of independently evolving loci; in the 1980s and 1990s, a second wave of origin-fixation models emerged to address a sequence of fixation events at a single locus. Although origin fixation models have been applied to a broad array of problems in contemporary evolutionary research, their rise in popularity has not been accompanied by an increased appreciation of their restrictive assumptions or their distinctive implications. We argue that origin-fixation models constitute a coherent theory of mutation-limited evolution that contrasts sharply with theories of evolution that rely on the presence of standing genetic variation. A major unsolved question in evolutionary biology is the degree to which these models provide an accurate approximation of evolution in natural populations.},

In all of these polyfunctional enzymes, a product formed from the catalytic reaction at one active site is a substrate for an enzymatic reaction at a distal active site. Reaction intermediates are translocated from one active site to the next through the participation of an intermolecular tunnel. The tunnel in tryptophan synthase is ?25 {\AA}in length, whereas the tunnel in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase is nearly 100 {\AA}long. Kinetic studies have demonstrated that the individual reactions are coordinated through allosteric coupling of one active site with another.

Abstract?The three-dimensional structures of tryptophan synthase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, and asparagine synthetase have revealed the relative locations of multiple active sites within these proteins. In all of these polyfunctional enzymes, a product formed from the catalytic reaction at one active site is a substrate for an enzymatic reaction at a distal active site. Reaction intermediates are translocated from one active site to the next through the participation of an intermolecular tunnel. The tunnel in tryptophan synthase is ?25 {\AA}in length, whereas the tunnel in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase is nearly 100 {\AA}long. Kinetic studies have demonstrated that the individual reactions are coordinated through allosteric coupling of one active site with another. The participation of these molecular tunnels is thought to protect reactive intermediates from coming in contact with the external medium.},

We found that independent beneficial mutations that affected gene expression for a metabolic pathway did not work well together, and were often jointly deleterious. The most beneficial mutations interacted the most poorly with others, which was a trend we found common in other biological systems. Through generating a model that accounted for enzymatic benefits and expression costs, we uncovered that this antagonism was caused by a phenotype to fitness mapping that had an intermediate peak. This allowed us to predict the fitness effect of double mutants and to uncover that the single winning mutations tended to move straight to the peak in a single step. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering the phenotypic changes that cause nonlinear interactions between mutations upon fitness, and thus influence how populations evolve.},

	N2 = {In principle, evolutionary outcomes could be largely predicted if all of the relevant physicochemical variants of a particular protein function under selection were known and integrated into an appropriate physiological model. We have tested this principle by generating a family of variants of the tetracycline resistance protein TetX2 and identified the physicochemical properties most correlated with organismal fitness. Surprisingly, small changes in the Km(MCN), less than twofold, were sufficient to produce highly successful adaptive mutants over clinically relevant drug concentrations. We then built a quantitative model directly relating the in vitro physicochemical properties of the mutant enzymes to the growth rates of bacteria carrying a single chromosomal copy of the tet(X2) variants over a wide range of minocycline (MCN) concentrations. Importantly, this model allows the prediction of enzymatic properties directly from cellular growth rates as well as the physicochemical-fitness landscape of TetX2. Using experimental evolution and deep sequencing to monitor the allelic frequencies of the seven most biochemically efficient TetX2 mutants in 10 independently evolving populations, we showed that the model correctly predicted the success of the two most beneficial variants tet(X2)T280A and tet(X2)N371I. The structure of the most efficient variant, TetX2T280A, in complex with MCN at 2.7 {\AA}resolution suggests an indirect effect on enzyme kinetics. Taken together, these findings support an important role for readily accessible small steps in protein evolution that can, in turn, greatly increase the fitness of an organism during natural selection.},

New technologies provide libraries of randomized sequences to study this relationship in unprecedented detail for proteins and other molecules. Deriving insight from these data is difficult, though, because the space of possible sequences is enormous, so even the largest experiments sample a tiny minority of sequences. Moreover, the effects of mutations may combine in unexpected ways. We present a statistical framework to analyze such mutagenesis data. The key assumption is that mutations contribute in a simple way to some unobserved trait, which is related to the observed trait by a nonlinear mapping. Analyzing three proteins, we show that this model is easily interpretable and yet fits the data remarkably well.Genotype--phenotype relationships are notoriously complicated. Idiosyncratic interactions between specific combinations of mutations occur and are difficult to predict. Yet it is increasingly clear that many interactions can be understood in terms of global epistasis. That is, mutations may act additively on some underlying, unobserved trait, and this trait is then transformed via a nonlinear function to the observed phenotype as a result of subsequent biophysical and cellular processes. Here we infer the shape of such global epistasis in three proteins, based on published high-throughput mutagenesis data. To do so, we develop a maximum-likelihood inference procedure using a flexible family of monotonic nonlinear functions spanned by an I-spline basis. Our analysis uncovers dramatic nonlinearities in all three proteins; in some proteins a model with global epistasis accounts for virtually all of the measured variation, whereas in others we find substantial local epistasis as well. This method allows us to test hypotheses about the form of global epistasis and to distinguish variance components attributable to global epistasis, local epistasis, and measurement error.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of enzymes and pathways is under debate. Recent studies show that recruitment of single enzymes from different pathways could be the driving force for pathway evolution. Other mechanisms of evolution, such as pathway duplication, enzyme specialization, de novo invention of pathways or retro-evolution of pathways, appear to be less abundant. Twenty percent of enzyme superfamilies are quite variable, not only in changing reaction chemistry or metabolite type but in changing both at the same time. These variable superfamilies account for nearly half of all known reactions. The most frequently occurring metabolites provide a helping hand for such changes because they can be accommodated by many enzyme superfamilies. Thus, a picture is emerging in which new pathways are evolving from central metabolites by preference, thereby keeping the overall topology of the metabolic network.},

	Abstract = {Building a genotype-phenotype-fitness map of adaptation is a central goal in evolutionary biology. It is difficult even when adaptive mutations are known because it is hard to enumerate which phenotypes make these mutations adaptive. We address this problem by first quantifying how the fitness of hundreds of adaptive yeast mutants responds to subtle environmental shifts. We then model the number of phenotypes these mutations collectively influence by decomposing these patterns of fitness variation. We find that a small number of inferred phenotypes can predict fitness of the adaptive mutations near their original glucose-limited evolution condition. Importantly, inferred phenotypes that matter little to fitness at or near the evolution condition can matter strongly in distant environments. This suggests that adaptive mutations are locally modular ---affecting a small number of phenotypes that matter to fitness in the environment where they evolved ---yet globally pleiotropic ---affecting additional phenotypes that may reduce or improve fitness in new environments.},

	N2 = {Abstract Fitness interactions between loci in the genome, or epistasis, can result in mutations that are individually deleterious but jointly beneficial. Such epistasis gives rise to multiple peaks on the genotypic fitness landscape. The problem of evolutionary escape from such local peaks has been a central problem of evolutionary genetics for at least 75 years. Much attention has focused on models of small populations, in which the sequential fixation of valley genotypes carrying individually deleterious mutations operates most quickly owing to genetic drift. However, valley genotypes can also be subject to mutation while transiently segregating, giving rise to copies of the high fitness escape genotype carrying the jointly beneficial mutations. In the absence of genetic recombination, these mutations may then fix simultaneously. The time for this process declines sharply with increasing population size, and it eventually comes to dominate evolutionary behavior. Here we develop an analytic expression for Ncrit, the critical population size that defines the boundary between these regimes, which shows that both are likely to operate in nature. Frequent recombination may disrupt high-fitness escape genotypes produced in populations larger than Ncrit before they reach fixation, defining a third regime whose rate again slows with increasing population size. We develop a novel expression for this critical recombination rate, which shows that in large populations the simultaneous fixation of mutations that are beneficial only jointly is unlikely to be disrupted by genetic recombination if their map distance is on the order of the size of single genes. Thus, counterintuitively, mass selection alone offers a biologically realistic resolution to the problem of evolutionary escape from local fitness peaks in natural populations.},

@article{Weissman09,
	Abstract = {Complex traits often involve interactions between different genetic loci. This can lead to sign epistasis, whereby mutations that are individually deleterious or neutral combine to confer a fitness benefit. In order to acquire the beneficial genotype, an asexual population must cross a fitness valley or plateau by first acquiring the deleterious or neutral intermediates. Here, we present a complete, intuitive theoretical description of the valley-crossing process across the full spectrum of possible parameter regimes. We calculate the rate at which a population crosses a fitness valley or plateau of arbitrary width, as a function of the mutation rates, the population size, and the fitnesses of the intermediates. We find that when intermediates are close to neutral, a large population can cross even wide fitness valleys remarkably quickly, so that valley-crossing dynamics may be common even when mutations that directly increase fitness are also possible. Thus the evolutionary dynamics of large populations can be sensitive to the structure of an extended region of the fitness landscape - the population may not take directly uphill paths in favor of paths across valleys and plateaus that lead eventually to fitter genotypes. In smaller populations, we find that below a threshold size, which depends on the width of the fitness valley and the strength of selection against intermediate genotypes, valley-crossing is much less likely and hence the evolutionary dynamics are less influenced by distant regions of the fitness landscape.},

	Abstract = {Cells compartmentalize their biochemical functions in a variety of ways, notably by creating physical barriers that separate a compartment via membranes or proteins. Eukaryotes have a wide diversity of membrane-based compartments, many that are lineage- or tissue-specific. In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that membrane-based compartmentalization of the cytosolic space is observed in multiple prokaryotic lineages, giving rise to several types of distinct prokaryotic organelles. Endosymbionts, previously believed to be a hallmark of eukaryotes, have been described in several bacteria. Protein-based compartments, frequent in bacteria, are also found in eukaryotes. In the present review, we focus on selected intracellular compartments from each of these three categories, membrane-based, endosymbiotic and protein-based, in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We review their diversity and the current theories and controversies regarding the evolutionary origins. Furthermore, we discuss the evolutionary processes acting on the genetic basis of intracellular compartments and how those differ across the domains of life. We conclude that the distinction between eukaryotes and prokaryotes no longer lies in the existence of a compartmentalized cell plan, but rather in its complexity.},

Spore formation in Bacillus subtilis, outer membrane biogenesis in Gram-negative bacteria and protein diffusion barriers of Caulobacter crescentus will be used to demonstrate the physical, chemical, and compositional remodeling events that lead to compartmentalization. In addition, magnetosomes and carboxysomes will serve as models to examine the interplay between cytoskeletal systems and the subcellular positioning of organelles.},

@article{Rodrigue17,
	Abstract = {Codon substitution models have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another modeling approach, known as the mutation--selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a model, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation--selection framework as a null model for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation parameter that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation--selection modeling framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use simulations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation--selection models in the detection of adaptation, calling for further model refinements as well as large-scale applications.},

	N2 = {Fitness effects of mutations fall on a continuum ranging from lethal to deleterious to beneficial. The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) among random mutations is an essential component of every evolutionary model and a mathematical portrait of robustness. Recent experiments on five viral species all revealed a characteristic bimodal-shaped DFE featuring peaks at neutrality and lethality. However, the phenotypic causes underlying observed fitness effects are still unknown and presumably, are thought to vary unpredictably from one mutation to another. By combining population genetics simulations with a simple biophysical protein folding model, we show that protein thermodynamic stability accounts for a large fraction of observed mutational effects. We assume that moderately destabilizing mutations inflict a fitness penalty proportional to the reduction in folded protein, which depends continuously on folding free energy (ΔG). Most mutations in our model affect fitness by altering ΔG, whereas based on simple estimates, ∼10{\%} abolish activity and are unconditionally lethal. Mutations pushing ΔG \&gt; 0 are also considered lethal. Contrary to neutral network theory, we find that, in mutation/selection/drift steady state, high mutation rates (m) lead to less stable proteins and a more dispersed DFE (i.e., less mutational robustness). Small population size (N) also decreases stability and robustness. In our model, a continuum of nonlethal mutations reduces fitness by ∼2{\%} on average, whereas ∼10--35{\%} of mutations are lethal depending on N and m. Compensatory mutations are common in small populations with high mutation rates. More broadly, we conclude that interplay between biophysical and population genetic forces shapes the DFE.},

	Abstract = {The rate of evolution varies among sites within proteins. In enzymes, two rate gradients are observed: rate decreases with increasing local packing and it increases with increasing distance from catalytic residues. The rate-packing gradient would be mainly due to stability constraints and is well reproduced by biophysical models with selection for protein stability. However, stability constraints are unlikely to account for the rate-distance gradient. Here, to explore the mechanistic underpinnings of the rate gradients observed in enzymes, I propose a stability--activity model of enzyme evolution, MSA. This model is based on a two-dimensional fitness function that depends on stability, quantified by ΔG, the enzyme's folding free energy, and activity, quantified by ΔG*, the activation energy barrier of the enzymatic reaction. I test MSA on a diverse data set of enzymes, comparing it with two simpler models: MS, which depends only on ΔG, and MA, which depends only on ΔG*. I found that MSA clearly outperforms both MS and MA and it accounts for both the rate-packing and rate-distance gradients. Thus, MSA captures the distribution of stability and activity constraints within enzymes, explaining the resulting patterns of rate variation among sites.},

We propose a mechanism, based on functional properties of enzymes and the kinetics of growth, which allows us to reconstruct the general course of early enzyme evolution. A precursor cell containing very few multifunctional enzymes with low catalytic activities is shown to lead inevitably to descendants with a large number of differentiated monofunctional enzymes with high turnover numbers.

	Abstract = {The consistent observation across all kingdoms of life that highly abundant proteins evolve slowly demonstrates that cellular abundance is a key determinant of protein evolutionary rate. However, other empirical findings, such as the broad distribution of evolutionary rates, suggest that additional variables determine the rate of protein evolution. Here, we report that under the global selection against the cytotoxic effects of misfolded proteins, folding stability (ΔG), simultaneous with abundance, is a causal variable of evolutionary rate. Using both theoretical analysis and multiscale simulations, we demonstrate that the anticorrelation between the premutation ΔG and the arising mutational effect (ΔΔG), purely biophysical in origin, is a necessary requirement for abundance-evolutionary rate covariation. Additionally, we predict and demonstrate in bacteria that the strength of abundance-evolutionary rate correlation depends on the divergence time separating reference genomes. Altogether, these results highlight the intrinsic role of protein biophysics in the emerging universal patterns of molecular evolution.},

While it has long been appreciated that topographic complexities on fitness landscapes can arise only as a consequence of epistatic interactions between mutations, evolutionary genetics has mainly focused on epistasis between pairs of mutations. Here we propose a generalization to the classical population genetic treatment of pairwise epistasis that yields expressions for epistasis among arbitrary subsets of mutations of all orders (pairwise, three-way, etc.). Our approach reveals substantial higher-order epistasis in almost every published fitness landscape. Furthermore we demonstrate that higher-order epistasis is critically important in two systems we know best. We conclude that higher-order epistasis deserves empirical and theoretical attention from evolutionary geneticists.},

	N2 = {Epistasis between mutations can make adaptation contingent on evolutionary history. Yet despite widespread ``microscopic''epistasis between the mutations involved, microbial evolution experiments show consistent patterns of fitness increases during laboratory adaptation. Recent work has found that this consistency is driven in part by global patterns of diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis, which make mutations systematically less beneficial (or more deleterious) on more-fit genetic backgrounds. This global ``macroscopic''epistasis is thought to make phenotypic evolution repeatable, even while the genetic basis of this evolution is highly stochastic. However, the mechanistic basis of consistent macroscopic epistasis remains unknown. Here we show, using a generic model of a complex trait, that global diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis arise naturally as a consequence of pervasive microscopic epistasis, emerging simply as a statistical trend due to an imbalance between positive and negative contributions to the fitness. Our model predicts a specific quantitative relationship between the magnitude of global epistasis and the stochastic effects of microscopic epistasis, which we confirm by re-analyzing existing data. We also describe the predictions of this model for the patterns of fitness evolution and for how the distribution of fitness effects shifts as a population adapts, and propose additional experimental tests of these results.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, neither the magnitude of the deleterious effect nor the primary mechanism of this effect is known. Here, we model the impact of expression noise on the fitness of unicellular organisms by considering the influence of suboptimal expressions of enzymes on the rate of biomass production and the energetic cost associated with imprecise amounts of protein synthesis. Our theoretical modeling and empirical analysis of yeast data show four findings. (i) Expression noise reduces the mean fitness of a cell by at least 25{\%}, and this reduction cannot be substantially alleviated by gene overexpression. (ii) Higher sensitivity of fitness to the expression fluctuations of essential genes than nonessential genes creates stronger selection against noise in essential genes, resulting in a decrease in their noise. (iii) Reduction of expression noise by genome doubling offers a substantial fitness advantage to diploids over haploids, even in the absence of sex. (iv) Expression noise generates fitness variation among isogenic cells, which lowers the efficacy of natural selection similar to the effect of population shrinkage. Thus, expression noise renders organisms both less adapted and less adaptable. Because expression noise is only one of many manifestations of the stochasticity in cellular molecular processes, our results suggest a much more fundamental role of molecular stochasticity in evolution than is currently appreciated.},

This study reveals that this very high TC content is forced upon the cell due to the slow diffusion of the large TCs in the crowded cytoplasm. A model is presented to describe how a bacterial cell solves the problem of proteomic resource allocation, balancing the two requirements for many ribosomes and for rapid translation. The model shows that proportional or approximately proportional synthesis of ribosomal proteins and TCs, as observed in Escherichia coli cells, is a near-optimal allocation scheme.Bacterial growth is crucially dependent on protein synthesis and thus on the cellular abundance of ribosomes and related proteins. Here, we show that the slow diffusion of the bulky tRNA complexes in the crowded cytoplasm imposes a physical limit on the speed of translation, which ultimately limits the rate of cell growth. To study the required allocation of ancillary translational proteins to alleviate the effect of molecular crowding, we develop a model for cell growth based on a coarse-grained partitioning of the proteome. We find that coregulation of ribosome- and tRNA-affiliated proteins is consistent with measured growth-rate dependencies and results in near-optimal allocation over a broad range of growth rates. The analysis further resolves a long-standing controversy in bacterial growth physiology concerning the growth-rate dependence of translation speed and serves as a caution against premature identification of phenomenological parameters with mechanistic processes.},

While diverse solutions to mitigate metabolite toxicity have evolved, less is known about how evolution itself is affected by metabolite toxicity. We hypothesized that the pace of molecular evolution should increase as metabolite toxicity increases. At least two mechanisms could cause this. First, metabolite toxicity could increase the mutation rate. Second, metabolite toxicity could increase the number of available mutations with large beneficial effects that selection could act upon (e.g., mutations that provide tolerance to toxicity), which consequently would increase the rate at which those mutations increase in frequency.},

	N2 = {New mutations tend to arise randomly throughout the genome, but their phenotypic effects are often not random. This disconnect results from interactions among genes that define the genotype--phenotype map. The structure of this map is poorly known and different for each trait, making it challenging to predict the distribution of mutational effects for specific phenotypes. Empirical measures of the distribution of mutational effects are thus necessary to understand how traits can change in the absence of natural selection. In this work, we define such distributions for expression of 10 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and show that they predict greater neutral expression divergence than commonly used models of phenotypic evolution.Understanding how phenotypes evolve requires disentangling the effects of mutation generating new variation from the effects of selection filtering it. Tests for selection frequently assume that mutation introduces phenotypic variation symmetrically around the population mean, yet few studies have tested this assumption by deeply sampling the distributions of mutational effects for particular traits. Here, we examine distributions of mutational effects for gene expression in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by measuring the effects of thousands of point mutations introduced randomly throughout the genome. We find that the distributions of mutational effects differ for the 10 genes surveyed and are inconsistent with normality. For example, all 10 distributions of mutational effects included more mutations with large effects than expected for normally distributed phenotypes. In addition, some genes also showed asymmetries in their distribution of mutational effects, with new mutations more likely to increase than decrease the gene's expression or vice versa. Neutral models of regulatory evolution that take these empirically determined distributions into account suggest that neutral processes may explain more expression variation within natural populations than currently appreciated.},

	Abstract = {Heritable differences in gene expression are caused by mutations in DNA sequences encoding cis-regulatory elements and trans-regulatory factors. These two classes of regulatory change differ in their relative contributions to expression differences in natural populations because of the combined effects of mutation and natural selection. Here, we investigate how new mutations create the regulatory variation upon which natural selection acts by quantifying the frequencies and effects of hundreds of new cis- and trans-acting mutations altering activity of the TDH3 promoter in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the absence of natural selection. We find that cis-regulatory mutations have larger effects on expression than trans-regulatory mutations and that while trans-regulatory mutations are more common overall, cis- and trans-regulatory changes in expression are equally abundant when only the largest changes in expression are considered. In addition, we find that cis-regulatory mutations are skewed toward decreased expression while trans-regulatory mutations are skewed toward increased expression. We also measure the effects of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations on the variability in gene expression among genetically identical cells, a property of gene expression known as expression noise, finding that trans-regulatory mutations are much more likely to decrease expression noise than cis-regulatory mutations. Because new mutations are the raw material upon which natural selection acts, these differences in the frequencies and effects of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations should be considered in models of regulatory evolution.},

Thus, mechanisms to prevent metabolite damage from occurring (metabolite damage preemption) or to convert damaged metabolites back to physiological forms (metabolite repair) are essential for sustained operation of metabolic networks. Some iconic examples of metabolite damage and its repair or preemption are associated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and other metabolite damage control systems are likely to exist here due to the inherent promiscuity of TCA cycle enzymes and reactivity of TCA cycle intermediates. Here, we review known metabolite damage reactions and metabolite damage control systems associated with the TCA cycle. This includes a previously unrecognized metabolite damage control system ? an oxaloacetate (OAA) enol-keto tautomerase activity that is ?built-in? to the TCA cycle. This activity is required to remove the highly inhibitory enol form of OAA and is likely to be critical for TCA cycle operation. By cataloging these instances, we show that metabolite damage and its repair or preemption is a prevalent feature of the TCA cycle and suggest many more metabolite damage control systems are likely to exist.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of metabolic control is examined with models that unify approaches of classical quantitative genetics and metabolic control theory. The quantitative traits considered are the activities of enzymes embedded within metabolic pathways. In the models, polygenic mutation alters the enzyme activities (Vmax/Km) according to prescribed distributions, and the population evolves following classical haploid viability selection. Stabilizing selection operates on global properties of the metabolic pathway, including either flux or metabolite pool concentration. Analytical results and numerical simulations demonstrate several important properties of these characters, including skewed, non-Gaussian equilibrium distributions, and an expected positive correlation between activities of enzymes flanking a substrate pool undergoing stabilizing selection. The house-of-cards approximation proved to be accurate in predicting the equilibrium distribution of allelic effects for a biologically reasonable segment of the parameter space. Further experimental and theoretical work is needed before a clear assessment can be made whether the observed variance in enzyme activities is explicable by a mutation-selection balance, and this system provides an excellent opportunity for such a test.},

A novel genetic procedure was employed in order to obtain amino acid substitutions within the lacZ-encoded β-galactosidase that result in differences in enzyme activity too small to be detected by ordinary mutant screens. The cryptic substitutions were obtained as spontaneous revertants of nonsense mutations within the lacZ gene, and the enzymes differing from wild type were identified by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or thermal denaturation studies. The relation between enzyme activity and growth rate of these and other mutants supports a model of intermediary metabolism in which the flux of substrate through a metabolic pathway is represented by a concave function of the activity of any enzyme in the pathway. The consequence is that small differences in enzyme activity from wild type result in even smaller changes in fitness.},

	Abstract = {Natural selection should be studied as an end in itself, and this requires rigorous experimental tests of theoretical models linking molecular phenotypes to differences in fitness. We describe the experimental verification of one such model and thereby demonstrate that the causal relations between genotype and fitness need not be as hopelessly complex as many have assumed. The model uses metabolic control theory to link enzyme activity to metabolic flux and then assumes that fitness is proportional to flux. The model was tested using the pathway for the uptake and metabolism of growth-rate-limiting concentrations of lactose in E. coli inhabiting chemostats. Many of the properties expected of natural selection are manifest in this system.},

	Abstract = {The fitnesses conferred by seven lactose operons, which had been transduced into a common genetic background from natural isolates of Escherichia coli, were determined during competition for growth rate-limiting quantities of galactosyl-glycerol, a naturally occurring galactoside. The fitnesses of these same operons have been previously determined on lactose and three artificial galactosides, lactulose, methyl-galactoside and galactosyl-arabinose. Analysis suggests that although marked genotype by environment interactions occur, changes in the fitness rankings are rare. The relative activities of the beta-galactosidases and the permeases were determined on galactosyl-glycerol, lactose, lactulose and methyl-galactoside. Both enzymes display considerable kinetic variation. The beta-galactosidase alleles provide no evidence for genotype by environment interactions at the level of enzyme activity. The permease alleles display genotype by environment interactions with a few causing changes in activity rankings. The contributions to fitness made by the permeases and the beta-galactosidases were partitioned using metabolic control analysis. Most of the genotype by environment interaction at the level of fitness is generated by changes in the distribution of control among steps in the pathway, particularly at the permease where large control coefficients ensure that its kinetic variation has marked fitness effects. Indeed, changes in activity rankings at the permease account for the few changes in fitness rankings. In contrast, the control coefficients of the beta-galactosidase are sufficiently small that its kinetic variation is in, or close to, the neutral limit. The selection coefficients are larger on the artificial galactosides because the control coefficients of the permease and beta-galactosidase are larger. The flux summation theorem requires that control coefficients associated with other steps in the pathway must be reduced, implying that the selection at these steps will be less intense on the artificial galactosides. This suggests that selection intensities need not be greater in novel environments.},

We redefine adaptive landscapes in terms of biological processes rather than descriptive phenomenology. We focus on the underlying mechanisms that generate emergent properties such as epistasis, dominance, trade-offs and adaptive peaks. We illustrate the utility of landscapes in predicting the course of adaptation and the distribution of fitness effects.

In so doing, we transform the landscape metaphor into a scientific framework within which causal hypotheses can be tested.},

	Abstract = {Bridging the gap between the molecular properties of proteins and organismal/population fitness is essential for understanding evolutionary processes. This task requires the integration of the several physical scales of biological organization, each defined by a distinct set of mechanisms and constraints, into a single unifying model. The molecular scale is dominated by the constraints imposed by the physico-chemical properties of proteins and their substrates, which give rise to trade-offs and epistatic (non-additive) effects of mutations. At the systems scale, biological networks modulate protein expression and can either buffer or enhance the fitness effects of mutations. The population scale is influenced by the mutational input, selection regimes, and stochastic changes affecting the size and structure of populations, which eventually determine the evolutionary fate of mutations. Here, we summarize the recent advances in theory, computer simulations, and experiments that advance our understanding of the links between various physical scales in biology.},

	Abstract = {Enzymes are thought to use their ordered structures to facilitate catalysis. A corollary of this theory suggests that enzyme residues involved in function are not optimized for stability. We tested this hypothesis by mutating functionally important residues in the active site of T4 lysozyme. Six mutations at two catalytic residues, Glu-11 and Asp-20, abolished or reduced enzymatic activity but increased thermal stability by 0.7-1.7 kcal.mol-1. Nine mutations at two substrate-binding residues, Ser-117 and Asn-132, increased stability by 1.2-2.0 kcal.mol-1, again at the cost of reduced activity. X-ray crystal structures show that the substituted residues complement regions of the protein surface that are used for substrate recognition in the native enzyme. In two of these structures the enzyme undergoes a general conformational change, similar to that seen in an enzyme-product complex. These results support a relationship between stability and function for T4 lysozyme. Other evidence suggests that the relationship is general.},

@article{Tokuriki07,
	Abstract = {How the thermodynamic stability effects of protein mutations (ΔΔG) are distributed is a fundamental property related to the architecture, tolerance to mutations (mutational robustness), and evolutionary history of proteins. The stability effects of mutations also dictate the rate and dynamics of protein evolution, with deleterious mutations being the main inhibitory factor. Using the FoldX algorithm that attempts to computationally predict ΔΔG effects of mutations, we deduced the overall distributions of stability effects for all possible mutations in 21 different globular, single domain proteins. We found that these distributions are strikingly similar despite a range of sizes and folds, and largely follow a bi-Gaussian function: The surface residues exhibit a narrow distribution with a mildly destabilizing mean ΔΔG (∼0.6 kcal/mol), whereas the core residues exhibit a wider distribution with a stronger destabilizing mean (∼1.4 kcal/mol). Since smaller proteins have a higher fraction of surface residues, the relative weight of these single distributions correlates with size. We also found that proteins evolved in the laboratory follow an essentially identical distribution, whereas de novo designed folds show markedly less destabilizing distributions (i.e. they seem more robust to the effects of mutations). This bi-Gaussian model provides an analytical description of the predicted distributions of mutational stability effects. It comprises a novel tool for analyzing proteins and protein models, for simulating the effect of mutations under evolutionary processes, and a quantitative description of mutational robustness.},

@article{DePristo05,
	Abstract = {In addition to functional properties, proteins have a wide range of biophysical characteristics, such as stability, propensity for aggregation and rate of degradation. These properties are at least as important as function for cellular and organismal fitness.Proteins tolerate only narrow ranges of stability, aggregation propensity and degradation rate. Many individual missense mutations perturb these traits by amounts that are on the same order as the permissible range of values, and are consequently common causes of human genetic disease.The narrow range of tolerance of deviations from optimum characteristics and the significant effects of mutations give rise to a substantial degree of epistasis for fitness. Moreover, mutations simultaneously affect function, stability, aggregation and degradation. For these reasons, mutations might be selectively beneficial on some genetic backgrounds and deleterious on others.Mutations that change function often do so at the cost of protein stability and aggregation. Compensatory mutations therefore function by relieving the biophysical strain that is introduced by adaptive mutations.We propose a new model of protein evolution that is reminiscent of a constrained 'random walk' through fitness space, which is based on the fitness consequences and distribution of mutational effects on function, stability, aggregation and degradation.This model can account for both the micro-evolutionary events that are studied by biochemists and the long-term patterns of protein evolution that are observed by evolutionary biologists.},

We validate our theory with simulations on lattice protein models and by showing that it quantitatively predicts previously published experimental measurements on subtilisin and our own measurements on variants of TEM1 β-lactamase.

Misfolded proteins form insoluble aggregates and are hypothesized to be intrinsically cytotoxic. Here, we experimentally isolate a fitness cost caused by toxicity of misfolded proteins. We exclude other costs of protein misfolding, such as loss of functional protein or attenuation of growth-limiting protein synthesis resources, by comparing growth rates of budding yeast expressing folded or misfolded variants of a gratuitous protein, YFP, at equal levels. We quantify a fitness cost that increases with misfolded protein abundance, up to as much as a 3.2{\%} growth rate reduction when misfolded YFP represents less than 0.1{\%} of total cellular protein. Comparable experiments on variants of the yeast gene orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase (URA3) produce similar results. Quantitative proteomic measurements reveal that, within the cell, misfolded YFP induces coordinated synthesis of interacting cytosolic chaperone proteins in the absence of a wider stress response, providing evidence for an evolved modular response to misfolded proteins in the cytosol. These results underscore the distinct and evolutionarily relevant molecular threat of protein misfolding, independent of protein function. Assuming that most misfolded proteins impose similar costs, yeast cells express almost all proteins at steady-state levels sufficient to expose their encoding genes to selection against misfolding, lending credibility to the recent suggestion that such selection imposes a global constraint on molecular evolution.},

The best predictor of evolutionary rate is expression level, for reasons that have remained unexplained. Here, we hypothesize that selection to reduce the burden of protein misfolding will favor protein sequences with increased robustness to translational missense errors. Pressure for translational robustness increases with expression level and constrains sequence evolution. Using several sequenced yeast genomes, global expression and protein abundance data, and sets of paralogs traceable to an ancient whole-genome duplication in yeast, we rule out several confounding effects and show that expression level explains roughly half the variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein evolutionary rates. We examine causes for expression's dominant role and find that genome-wide tests favor the translational robustness explanation over existing hypotheses that invoke constraints on function or translational efficiency. Our results suggest that proteins evolve at rates largely unrelated to their functions and can explain why highly expressed proteins evolve slowly across the tree of life.},

	Abstract = {Proteins might experience many conformational changes and interactions during their lifetimes, from their synthesis at ribosomes to their controlled degradation. Because, in most cases, only folded proteins are functional, protein folding in bacteria is tightly controlled genetically, transcriptionally, and at the protein sequence level. In addition, important cellular machinery assists the folding of polypeptides to avoid misfolding and ensure the attainment of functional structures. When these redundant protective strategies are overcome, misfolded polypeptides are recruited into insoluble inclusion bodies. The protein embedded in these intracellular deposits might display different conformations including functional and β-sheet-rich structures. The latter assemblies are similar to the amyloid fibrils characteristic of several human neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, bacteria exploit the same structural principles for functional properties such as adhesion or cytotoxicity. Overall, this review illustrates how prokaryotic organisms might provide the bedrock on which to understand the complexity of protein folding and aggregation in the cell.},

	N2 = {Abstract Most globular proteins are marginally stable regardless of size or activity. The most common interpretation is that proteins must be marginally stable in order to function, and so marginal stability represents the results of positive selection. We consider the issue of marginal stability directly using model proteins and the dynamical aspects of protein evolution in populations. We find that the marginal stability of proteins is an inherent property of proteins due to the high dimensionality of the sequence space, without regard to protein function. In this way, marginal stability can result from neutral, non-adaptive evolution. By allowing evolving protein sub-populations with different stability requirements for functionality to complete, we find that marginally stable populations of proteins tend to dominate. Our results show that functionalities consistent with marginal stability have a strong evolutionary advantage, and might arise because of the natural tendency of proteins towards marginal stability.

Genomic data have shown a strong influence of the expression level of a protein on its rate of sequence evolution (E-R anticorrelation), which is currently explained by the protein misfolding avoidance hypothesis. Here, we show that this hypothesis does not fully explain the E-R anticorrelation, especially for protein surface residues. We propose that natural selection against protein--protein misinteraction, which wastes functional molecules and is potentially toxic, constrains the evolution of surface residues. Because highly expressed proteins are under stronger pressures to avoid misinteraction, surface residues are expected to show an E-R anticorrelation. Our molecular-level evolutionary simulation and yeast genomic analysis confirm multiple predictions of the hypothesis. These findings show a pluralistic origin of the E-R anticorrelation and reveal the role of protein misinteraction, an inherent property of complex cellular systems, in constraining protein evolution.},

It has been shown previously that fibrillar aggregates that are closely similar to those associated with clinical amyloidoses can be formed in vitro from proteins not connected with these diseases, including the SH3 domain from bovine phosphatidyl-inositol-3'-kinase and the amino-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli HypF protein. Here we show that species formed early in the aggregation of these non-disease-associated proteins can be inherently highly cytotoxic. This finding provides added evidence that avoidance of protein aggregation is crucial for the preservation of biological function and suggests common features in the origins of this family of protein deposition diseases.},

	Abstract = {The most common cause of monogenic disease is a single base DNA variant resulting in an amino acid substitution. In a previous study, we observed that a high fraction of these substitutions appear to result in reduction of stability of the corresponding protein structure. We have now investigated this phenomenon more fully. A set of structural effects, such as reduction in hydrophobic area, overpacking, backbone strain, and loss of electrostatic interactions, is used to represent the impact of single residue mutations on protein stability. A support vector machine (SVM) was trained on a set of mutations causative of disease, and a control set of non-disease causing mutations. In jack-knifed testing, the method identifies 74% of disease mutations, with a false positive rate of 15%. Evaluation of a set of in vitro mutagenesis data with the SVM established that the majority of disease mutations affect protein stability by 1 to 3 kcal/mol. The method's effective distinction between disease and non-disease variants, strongly supports the hypothesis that loss of protein stability is a major factor contributing to monogenic disease.},

	Abstract = {Different proteins have different expression levels. It is unclear to what extent these expression levels are optimized to their environment. Evolutionary theories suggest that protein expression levels maximize fitness1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, but the fitness as a function of protein level has seldom been directly measured. To address this, we studied the lac system of Escherichia coli, which allows the cell to use the sugar lactose for growth12. We experimentally measured the growth burden13,14 due to production and maintenance of the Lac proteins (cost), as well as the growth advantage (benefit) conferred by the Lac proteins when lactose is present. The fitness function, given by the difference between the benefit and the cost, predicts that for each lactose environment there exists an optimal Lac expression level that maximizes growth rate. We then performed serial dilution evolution experiments at different lactose concentrations. In a few hundred generations, cells evolved to reach the predicted optimal expression levels. Thus, protein expression from the lac operon seems to be a solution of a cost--benefit optimization problem, and can be rapidly tuned by evolution to function optimally in new environments.},

	Abstract = {The ultimate overexpression of a protein could cause growth defects, which are known as the protein burden. However, the expression limit at which the protein-burden effect is triggered is still unclear. To estimate this limit, we systematically measured the overexpression limits of glycolytic proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The limits of some glycolytic proteins were up to 15{\%} of the total cellular protein. These limits were independent of the proteins'catalytic activities, a finding that was supported by an in silico analysis. Some proteins had low expression limits that were explained by their localization and metabolic perturbations. The codon usage should be highly optimized to trigger the protein-burden effect, even under strong transcriptional induction. The S--S-bond-connected aggregation mediated by the cysteine residues of a protein might affect its expression limit. Theoretically, only non-harmful proteins could be expressed up to the protein-burden limit. Therefore, we established a framework to distinguish proteins that are harmful and non-harmful upon overexpression.},

	Abstract = {Biological cells are complex environments that are densely packed with macromolecules and subdivided by membranes, both of which affect the rates of chemical reactions. It is well known that crowding reduces the volume available to reactants, which increases reaction rates, and also inhibits reactant diffusion, which decreases reaction rates. This work investigates these effects quantitatively using analytical theory and particle-based simulations. A reaction rate equation based on only these two processes turned out to be inconsistent with simulation results. However, accounting for diffusion inhibition by the surfaces of nearby obstacles, which affects access to reactants, it led to perfect agreement for reactions near impermeable planar membranes and improved agreement for reactions in crowded spaces. A separate model that quantified reactant occlusion by crowders, and extensions to a thermodynamic 'cavity' model proposed by Berezhkovskii and Szabo [25], were comparably successful. These results help elucidate reaction dynamics in confined spaces and improve prediction of in vivo reaction rates from in vitro ones.},

Instead, we find that there is a cumulative breakdown of rRNAs, which results in a loss of ribosomes and protein synthetic capacity. After either of the test genes is maximally induced, there is a growing fraction of protein synthesis invested in beta-galactosidase or delta tufB that is matched by a comparable decrease of the fraction of normal protein synthesis. We have also observed enhanced accumulation of two heat shock proteins during overexpression. Finally, after several hours of overexpression of either test protein, the bacteria are no longer viable.

	Abstract = {A new approach to measuring the slowing of growth due to the manufacture of proteins not needed by a bacterium is presented. An entire single colony of Escherichia coli was used to start a chemostat culture that was then given a selective pressure by the addition of phenylgalactoside (phi-gal). This enriched the population for constitutive mutants that produced beta-galactosidase without induction and could split phi-gal, consume the galactose, and grow faster. When the phi-gal was removed, the constitutives grew slower than the parental strain and were gradually lost. This procedure allows competition experiments to be carried out with minimum effects due to genetic drift. Experiments with both strains having wild-type and mutant permease genes were conducted. With the former the selective disadvantage was initially much greater than expected from the simplest hypothesis that extra unused proteins would slow growth in proportion to their fraction of the total protein synthesis. This phase was followed by a second phase where the selective disadvantage was smaller than predicted by this simple hypothesis. With a very slowly reverting permease negative strain the selective disadvantage, and therefore the protein burden, was found to be much smaller and not statistically different from zero. Thus, while one would expect under carbon and energy limitation in the chemostat the protein burden to be larger than under unlimited conditions, it is so small that even the refined technique used here could not measure it accurately. It is certainly less than the fraction of 'waste' protein synthesis; but it could be between zero and the fraction of the cells' energy and carbon budget spent on manufacture of the proteins of the lac operon.},

Attempts to model cellular physiology are limited by the scarcity of experimental data defining the molecular processes limiting protein expression. Here, we distinguish the relative contribution of gene transcription and protein translation to the slower proliferation of budding yeast producing excess levels of unneeded proteins. In contrast to widely held assumptions, rapidly growing cells are not universally limited by ribosome content. Rather, transcription dominates cost under some conditions (e.g., low phosphate), translation in others (e.g., low nitrogen), and both in other conditions (e.g., rich media). Furthermore, cells adapted to enforced protein production by becoming larger and increasing their endogenous protein levels, suggesting limited competition for common resources. We propose that rapidly growing cells do not exhaust their resources to maximize growth but maintain sufficient reserves to accommodate changing requirements.},

Why do mesophilic cells die around 50 $\,^{\circ}$C? How can the maximal growth-rate temperature (around 37 $\,^{\circ}$C) occur so close to the cell-death temperature? The model shows that the cell's death temperature coincides with a denaturation catastrophe of its proteome. The reason cells can function so well just a few degrees below their death temperature is because proteome denaturation is so cooperative. Why are cells so dense-packed with protein molecules (about 20{\%} by volume)? Cells are packed at a density that maximizes biochemical reaction rates. At lower densities, proteins collide too rarely. At higher densities, proteins diffuse too slowly through the crowded cell. What limits cell sizes and growth rates? Cell growth is limited by rates of protein synthesis, by the folding rates of its slowest proteins, and---for large cells---by the rates of its protein diffusion. Useful insights into cell physics may be obtainable from scaling laws that encapsulate information from protein knowledge bases.},

A theory incorporating these constraints can accurately predict how cell proliferation and gene expression affect one another, quantitatively accounting for the effect of translation-inhibiting antibiotics on gene expression and the effect of gratuitous protein expression on cell growth.

Trained on experimental data, these models achieve unrivaled quantitative accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit representation of model uncertainty allows for efficient searches through the vast space of possible sequences. We develop and test two protein sequence design algorithms motivated by Bayesian decision theory. The first one identifies small sets of sequences that are informative about the landscape; the second one identifies optimized sequences by iteratively improving the Gaussian process model in regions of the landscape that are predicted to be optimized. We demonstrate the ability of Gaussian processes to guide the search through protein sequence space by designing, constructing, and testing chimeric cytochrome P450s. These algorithms allowed us to engineer active P450 enzymes that are more thermostable than any previously made by chimeragenesis, rational design, or directed evolution.},

Our method is able to capture epistatic couplings between residues, and therefore to assess the dependence of mutational effects on the sequence context where they appear. Compared with recent large-scale mutagenesis data of the beta-lactamase TEM-1, a protein providing resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics, our method leads to an increase of about 40{\%} in explicative power as compared with approaches neglecting epistasis.

@article{Stiffler15,
	Abstract = {Summary
Evolvability---the capacity to generate beneficial heritable variation---is a central property of biological systems. However, its origins and modulation by environmental factors have not been examined systematically. Here, we analyze the fitness effects of all single mutations in TEM-1 β-lactamase (4,997 variants) under selection for the wild-type function (ampicillin resistance) and for a new function (cefotaxime resistance). Tolerance to mutation in this enzyme is bimodal and dependent on the strength of purifying selection in vivo, a result that derives from a steep non-linear ampicillin-dependent relationship between biochemical activity and fitness. Interestingly, cefotaxime resistance emerges from mutations that are neutral at low levels of ampicillin but deleterious at high levels; thus the capacity to evolve new function also depends on the strength of selection. The key property controlling evolvability is an excess of enzymatic activity relative to the strength of selection, suggesting that fluctuating environments might select for high-activity enzymes.

Here, we show that a protein's capacity to evolve is enhanced by the mutational robustness conferred by extra stability. We use simulations with model lattice proteins to demonstrate how extra stability increases evolvability by allowing a protein to accept a wider range of beneficial mutations while still folding to its native structure. We confirm this view experimentally by mutating marginally stable and thermostable variants of cytochrome P450 BM3. Mutants of the stabilized parent were more likely to exhibit new or improved functions. Only the stabilized P450 parent could tolerate the highly destabilizing mutations needed to confer novel activities such as hydroxylating the antiinflammatory drug naproxen.

We show that we can exploit this link to discover protein functions, and we suggest how natural evolution might do the same.},

Most computational methods assume that replacements in one sequence will be tolerated in all related sequences. Here, we evaluate---by direct experiment---the functional impact of amino acid replacements accumulated during the course of evolution. Our initial results show that cryptic interactions among amino acid replacements are common and that most are deleterious. This result has implications not only for the evolution of function, recombination, sex, dominance, robustness, disease, and even speciation, but also for practical applications---in conservation biology (e.g. to decide which organisms to preserve) and in vaccine design (e.g. using consensus or reconstructed ancestral sequences). Analyzing one interaction in detail, we find that compensatory mutations need not lie in close proximity to the original mutation as generally supposed. This result suggests that unsuspected structure--function relationships can be revealed by analyzing patterns of site-to-site interactions among amino acid replacements in evolution.},

	Abstract = {Previous experiments with temperature-sensitive mutants of the yeast enzyme orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (encoded in gene URA3) yielded the unexpected result that reversion occurs only through exact reversal of the original mutation (Jakubowska A, Korona R. 2009. Lack of evolutionary conservation at positions important for thermal stability in the yeast ODCase protein. Mol Biol Evol. 26(7):1431-1434.). We recreated a set of these mutations in which the codon had two nucleotide substitutions, making exact reversion much less likely. We screened these double mutants for reversion and obtained a number of compensatory mutations occurring at alternative sites in the molecule. None of these compensatory mutations fully restored protein performance. The mechanism of partial compensation is consistent with a model in which protein stabilization is additive, as the same secondary mutations can compensate different primary alternations. The distance between primary and compensatory residues precludes direct interaction between the sites. Instead, most of the compensatory mutants were clustered in proximity to the catalytic center. All of the second-site compensatory substitutions occurred at relatively conserved sites, and the amino acid replacements were to residues found at these sites in a multispecies alignment of the protein. Based on the estimated distribution of changes in Gibbs free energy among a large number of amino acid replacements, we estimate that, for most proteins, the probability that a second-site mutation would have a sufficiently large stabilizing effect to offset a temperature-sensitive mutation in the order of 10-4 or less. Hence compensation is likely to take place only for slightly destabilizing mutations because highly stabilizing mutations are exceeding rare.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive protein evolution may be facilitated by neutral amino acid mutations that confer no benefit when they first arise but which potentiate subsequent function-altering mutations via direct or indirect structural mechanisms. Theoretical and empirical results indicate that such compensatory interactions (intramolecular epistasis) can exert a strong influence on trajectories of protein evolution. For this reason, assessing the form and prevalence of intramolecular epistasis and characterizing biophysical mechanisms of compensatory interaction are important research goals at the nexus of structural biology and molecular evolution. Here I review recent insights derived from protein-engineering studies, and I describe an approach for identifying and characterizing mechanisms of epistasis that integrates experimental data on structure-function relationships with analyses of comparative sequence data.},

	Abstract = {For decades, rates of protein evolution have been interpreted in terms of the vague concept of functional importance. Slowly evolving proteins or sites within proteins were assumed to be more functionally important and thus subject to stronger selection pressure. More recently, biophysical models of protein evolution, which combine evolutionary theory with protein biophysics, have completely revolutionized our view of the forces that shape sequence divergence. Slowly evolving proteins have been found to evolve slowly because of selection against toxic misfolding and misinteractions, linking their rate of evolution primarily to their abundance. Similarly, most slowly evolving sites in proteins are not directly involved in function, but mutating these sites has a large impact on protein structure and stability. In this article, we review the studies in the emerging field of biophysical protein evolution that have shaped our current understanding of sequence divergence patterns. We also propose future research directions to develop this nascent field.},

@article{Schreiber94,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Barstar is the intracellular inhibitor of barnase, an extracellular RNAse of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The dissociation constant of the barnase-barstar complex is 10(-14) M with an association rate constant between barnase and barstar of 3.7 x 10(8) s-1 M-1. The rapid association arises in part from the clustering of four acidic residues (Asp35, Asp39, Glu76 and Glu80) on the barnase-binding surface of barstar. The negatively charged barnase-binding surface of barstar effectively 'steers' the inhibitor towards the positively charged active site of barnase.
RESULTS: Mutating any one of the four acidic side chains of barstar to an alanine results in an approximately two-fold decrease in the association rate constant, while the dissociation rate constant increases from five orders of magnitude for Asp39-->Ala, to no significant change for Glu80-->Ala. The stability of barstar is increased by all four mutations, the increase ranging from 0.3 kcal mol-1 for Asp35-->Ala or Asp39-->Ala, to 2.1 kcal mol-1 for Glu80-->Ala.
CONCLUSIONS: The evolutionary pressure on barstar for rapid binding of barnase is so strong that glutamate is preferred over alanine at position 80, even though it does not directly interact with barnase in the complex and significantly destabilizes the inhibitor structure. This, and other examples from the literature, suggest that proteins evolve primarily to optimize their function in vivo, with relatively little evolutionary pressure to increase stability above a certain threshold, thus allowing greater latitude in the evolution of enzyme activity.},

Here, we report refined estimates of the mutation rate for a prokaryote with an exceptionally small genome and for a unicellular eukaryote with a large genome. Combined with prior results, these estimates provide the basis for a potentially unifying explanation for the wide range in mutation rates that exists among organisms. Natural selection appears to reduce the mutation rate of a species to a level that scales negatively with both the effective population size (Ne), which imposes a drift barrier to the evolution of molecular refinements, and the genomic content of coding DNA, which is proportional to the target size for deleterious mutations. As a consequence of an expansion in genome size, some microbial eukaryotes with large Ne appear to have evolved mutation rates that are lower than those known to occur in prokaryotes, but multicellular eukaryotes have experienced elevations in the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate because of substantial reductions in Ne.},

	Abstract = {Gene expression evolution can be caused by changes in cis- or trans-regulatory elements or both. As cis and trans regulation operate through different molecular mechanisms, cis and trans mutations may show different inheritance patterns and may be subjected to different selective constraints. To investigate these issues, we obtained and analyzed gene expression data from two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and their hybrid, using high-throughput sequencing. Our data indicate that compared with other types of genes, those with antagonistic cis--trans interactions are more likely to exhibit over- or underdominant inheritance of expression level. Moreover, in accordance with previous studies, genes with trans variants tend to have a dominant inheritance pattern, whereas cis variants are enriched for additive inheritance. In addition, cis regulatory differences contribute more to expression differences between species than within species, whereas trans regulatory differences show a stronger association between divergence and polymorphism. Our data indicate that in the trans component of gene expression differences genes subjected to weaker selective constraints tend to have an excess of polymorphism over divergence compared with those subjected to stronger selective constraints. In contrast, in the cis component, this difference between genes under stronger and weaker selective constraint is mostly absent. To explain these observations, we propose that purifying selection more strongly shapes trans changes than cis changes and that positive selection may have significantly contributed to cis regulatory divergence.},

@article{Moreira15,
	Abstract = {The recent discovery of diverse very large viruses, such as the mimivirus, has fostered a profusion of hypotheses positing that these viruses define a new domain of life together with the three cellular ones (Archaea, Bacteria and Eucarya). It has also been speculated that they have played a key role in the origin of eukaryotes as donors of important genes or even as the structures at the origin of the nucleus. Thanks to the increasing availability of genome sequences for these giant viruses, those hypotheses are amenable to testing via comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses. This task is made very difficult by the high evolutionary rate of viruses, which induces phylogenetic artefacts, such as long branch attraction, when inadequate methods are applied. It can be demonstrated that phylogenetic trees supporting viruses as a fourth domain of life are artefactual. In most cases, the presence of homologues of cellular genes in viruses is best explained by recurrent horizontal gene transfer from cellular hosts to their infecting viruses and not the opposite. Today, there is no solid evidence for the existence of a viral domain of life or for a significant implication of viruses in the origin of the cellular domains.},

	Abstract = {1. The concentrations of the oxidized and reduced substrates of the lactate-, beta-hydroxybutyrate- and glutamate-dehydrogenase systems were measured in rat livers freeze-clamped as soon as possible after death. The substrates of these dehydrogenases are likely to be in equilibrium with free NAD(+) and NADH, and the ratio of the free dinucleotides can be calculated from the measured concentrations of the substrates and the equilibrium constants (Holzer, Schultz & Lynen, 1956; B{\"u}cher & Klingenberg, 1958). The lactate-dehydrogenase system reflects the [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio in the cytoplasm, the beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase that in the mitochondrial cristae and the glutamate dehydrogenase that in the mitochondrial matrix. 2. The equilibrium constants of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) were redetermined for near-physiological conditions (38 degrees ; I0.25). 3. The mean [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio of rat-liver cytoplasm was calculated as 725 (pH7.0) in well-fed rats, 528 in starved rats and 208 in alloxan-diabetic rats. 4. The [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio for the mitochondrial matrix and cristae gave virtually identical values in the same metabolic state. This indicates that beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase share a common pool of dinucleotide. 5. The mean [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio within the liver mitochondria of well-fed rats was about 8. It fell to about 5 in starvation and rose to about 10 in alloxan-diabetes. 6. The [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratios of cytoplasm and mitochondria are thus greatly different and do not necessarily move in parallel when the metabolic state of the liver changes. 7. The ratios found for the free dinucleotides differ greatly from those recorded for the total dinucleotides because much more NADH than NAD(+) is protein-bound. 8. The bearing of these findings on various problems, including the following, is discussed: the number of NAD(+)-NADH pools in liver cells; the applicability of the method to tissues other than liver; the transhydrogenase activity of glutamate dehydrogenase; the physiological significance of the difference of the redox states of mitochondria and cytoplasm; aspects of the regulation of the redox state of cell compartments; the steady-state concentration of mitochondrial oxaloacetate; the relations between the redox state of cell compartments and ketosis.},

The concept of neutral mutant substitution in the population by random genetic drift can be extended to include random fixation of very slightly deleterious mutations which have more chance of being selected against than of being selected for3,4. If this class of mutant substitution is important, we can predict that the evolution is rapid in small populations or at the time of speciation5.

The pathway information is also represented by the ortholog group tables summarizing orthologous and paralogous gene groups among different organisms. KEGG maintains the GENES database for the gene catalogs of all organisms with complete genomes and selected organisms with partial genomes, which are continuously re-annotated, as well as the LIGAND database for chemical compounds and enzymes. Each gene catalog is associated with the graphical genome map for chromosomal locations that is represented by Java applet. In addition to the data collection efforts, KEGG develops and provides various computational tools, such as for reconstructing biochemical pathways from the complete genome sequence and for predicting gene regulatory networks from the gene expression profiles. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/).},

Our recent analysis shows that this and other genomic units correspond to chemical units reflecting chemical logic of organic reactions. From all known metabolic pathways in the KEGG database we identified chemical units, called reaction modules, as the conserved sequences of chemical structure transformation patterns of small molecules. The extracted patterns suggest co-evolution of genomic units and chemical units. While the core of the metabolic network may have evolved with mechanisms involving individual enzymes and reactions, its extension may have been driven by modular units of enzymes and reactions.},

Here we study the impact of the limited solvent capacity constraint on the metabolic rate, enzyme activities, and metabolite concentrations using a computational model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycolysis as a case study. We show that given the limited solvent capacity constraint, the optimal enzyme activities and the metabolite concentrations necessary to achieve a maximum rate of glycolysis are in agreement with their experimentally measured values. Furthermore, the predicted maximum glycolytic rate determined by the solvent capacity constraint is close to that measured in vivo. These results indicate that the limited solvent capacity is a relevant constraint acting on S. cerevisiae at physiological growth conditions, and that a full kinetic model together with the limited solvent capacity constraint can be used to predict both metabolite concentrations and enzyme activities in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the limitations of the metabolite concentrations and the conservation of solvent capacity in the living cell. The maintenance of low concentrations of metabolites may well be the most pressing problem of metabolic control. Several features of metabolism and of metabolic enzymes appear to represent adaptations to the need to limit solute concentrations and to conserve solvent capacity. Conservation of low concentrations of metabolites, both individually and collectively, is one of the most fundamental requisites for a viable metabolizing system. If concentrations of intermediates are to be kept low, it is necessary that the Michaelis constant of each enzyme involved in a sequence has an appropriate value and that the activity of each enzyme is high enough to handle the maximal flux through the sequence without the substrate concentration rising much above this Michaelis value. The activation of metabolic intermediates, coordinate derepression, or induction contributes to stability and survival through aiding in the conservation of low concentrations within the cell.},

@article{Reddy12,
	Abstract = {The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) is the largest known superfamily of secondary carriers found in the biosphere. It is ubiquitously distributed throughout virtually all currently recognized organismal phyla. This superfamily currently (2012) consists of 74 families, each of which is usually concerned with the transport of a certain type of substrate. Many of these families, defined phylogenetically, do not include even a single member that is functionally characterized. In this article, we probe the evolutionary origins of these transporters, providing evidence that they arose from a single 2-transmembrane segment (TMS) hairpin structure that triplicated to give a 6-TMS unit that duplicated to a 12-TMS protein, the most frequent topological type of these permeases. We globally examine MFS protein topologies, focusing on exceptional proteins that deviate from the norm. Nine distantly related families appear to have members with 14 TMSs in which the extra two are usually centrally localized between the two 6-TMS repeat units. They probably have arisen by intragenic duplication of an adjacent hairpin. This alternative topology probably arose multiple times during MFS evolution. Convincing evidence for MFS permeases with fewer than 12 TMSs was not forthcoming, leading to the suggestion that all 12 TMSs are required for optimal function. Some homologs appear to have 13, 14, 15 or 16 TMSs, and the probable locations of the extra TMSs were identified. A few MFS permeases are fused to other functional domains or are fully duplicated to give 24-TMS proteins with dual functions. Finally, the MFS families with no known function were subjected to genomic context analyses leading to functional predictions.},

@article{Ovadi04,
	Abstract = {The history of the development of the ideas and research of organized metabolic systems during last three decades is shortly reviewed. The cell cytoplasm is crowded with solutes, soluble macromolecules such as enzymes, nucleic acids, structural proteins and membranes. The high protein density within the large compartments of the cells predominantly determines the major characteristics of cellular environment such as viscosity, diffusion and inhomogeneity. The fact that the solvent viscosity of cytoplasm is not substantially different from the water is explained by intracellular structural heterogeneity: the intrinsic macromolecular density is relatively low within the interstitial voids in the cell because many soluble enzymes are apparently integral parts of the insoluble cytomatrix and are not distributed homogeneously. The molecular crowding and sieving restrict the mobility of very large solutes, binding severely restrict the mobility of smaller solutes. One of consequence of molecular crowding and hindered diffusion is the need to compartmentalize metabolic pathway to overcome diffusive barriers. Although the movement of small molecules is slowed down in the cytoplasm, the metabolism can successfully proceed and even be facilitated by metabolite channeling which directly transfers the intermediate from one enzyme to an adjacent enzyme without the need of free aqueous-phase diffusion. The enhanced probability for intermediates to be transfered from one active site to the other by sequential enzymes requires stable or transient interactions of the relevant enzymes, which associate physically in non-dissociable, static multienzyme complexes --metabolones, particles containing enzymes of a part or whole metabolic systems. Therefore, within the living cell the metabolism depends on the structural organization of enzymes forming microcompartments. Since cells contain many compartments and microenvironments, the measurement of the concentration of metabolites in whole cells or tissues gives an average cellular concentration and not that which is actually sensed by the active site of a specific enzyme. Thus, the microcompartmentation could provide a mechanism which can control metabolic pathways. Independently and in parallel to the developments described above, the ideas of compartmentation came into existence from the necessity to explain important physiological phenomena, in particular in heart research and in cardiac electrophysiology. These phenomena demonstrated the physiological importance of the biophysical and biochemical mechanisms described in this review.},

@article{Boer10,
	Abstract = {Microbes tailor their growth rate to nutrient availability. Here, we measured, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, >100 intracellular metabolites in steady-state cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae growing at five different rates and in each of five different limiting nutrients. In contrast to gene transcripts, where approximately 25{\%} correlated with growth rate irrespective of the nature of the limiting nutrient, metabolite concentrations were highly sensitive to the limiting nutrient's identity. Nitrogen (ammonium) and carbon (glucose) limitation were characterized by low intracellular amino acid and high nucleotide levels, whereas phosphorus (phosphate) limitation resulted in the converse. Low adenylate energy charge was found selectively in phosphorus limitation, suggesting the energy charge may actually measure phosphorus availability. Particularly strong concentration responses occurred in metabolites closely linked to the limiting nutrient, e.g., glutamine in nitrogen limitation, ATP in phosphorus limitation, and pyruvate in carbon limitation. A simple but physically realistic model involving the availability of these metabolites was adequate to account for cellular growth rate.

Here, we characterize the fitness landscape of the six amino acids controlling coenzyme use in isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IMDH). Although all natural IMDHs use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as a coenzyme, they can be engineered to use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) instead. Intermediates between these two phenotypic extremes show that each amino acid contributes additively to enzyme function, with epistatic contributions confined to fitness. The genotype-phenotype-fitness map shows that NAD use is a global optimum.},

At low amounts of crowding agent, we detect increases in both of KM (weaker substrate binding) and kcat (improved catalytic efficiency), whereas at higher crowding levels, both parameters were reduced. Presence of crowding agents does not affect Fet3p structural content but increases thermal resistance. The observations are compatible with ordering of a non-optimal substrate-binding site and restricted internal dynamics as a result of excluded volume effects making the protein less structurally `strained'.},

	Abstract = {Stoichiometric analysis of metabolic networks allows the calculation of possible metabolic flux distributions in the absence of kinetic data. In order to predict which of the possible fluxes are present under certain conditions, additional constraints and optimization principles can be applied. One approach of calculating unknown fluxes (frequently called flux balance analysis) is based on the optimality principle of maximizing the molar yield of biotransformations. Here, the relevance and applicability of that approach are examined, and it is compared with the principle of maximizing pathway flux. We discuss diverse experimental evidence showing that, often, those biochemical pathways are operative that allow fast but low-yield synthesis of important products, such as fermentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and several other yeast species. Together with arguments based on evolutionary game theory, this leads us to the conclusion that maximization of molar yield is by no means a universal principle.},

	Abstract = {Systems biology describes cellular phenotypes as properties that emerge from the complex interactions of individual system components. Little is known about how these interactions have affected the evolution of metabolic enzymes. Here, we combine genome-scale metabolic modeling with population genetics models to simulate the evolution of enzyme turnover numbers (kcats) from a theoretical ancestor with inefficient enzymes. This systems view of biochemical evolution reveals strong epistatic interactions between metabolic genes that shape evolutionary trajectories and influence the magnitude of evolved kcats. Diminishing returns epistasis prevents enzymes from developing higher kcats in all reactions and keeps the organism far from the potential fitness optimum. Multifunctional enzymes cause synergistic epistasis that slows down adaptation. The resulting fitness landscape allows kcat evolution to be convergent. Predicted kcat parameters show a significant correlation with experimental data, validating our modeling approach. Our analysis reveals how evolutionary forces shape modern kcats and the whole of metabolism.},

	Abstract = {Optimization processes, such as evolution, are constrained by diminishing returns---the closer the optimum, the smaller the benefit per mutation, and by tradeoffs---improvement of one property at the cost of others. However, the magnitude and molecular basis of these parameters, and their effect on evolutionary transitions, remain unknown. Here we pursue a complete functional transition of an enzyme with a >109-fold change in the enzyme's selectivity using laboratory evolution. We observed strong diminishing returns, with the initial mutations conferring >25-fold higher improvements than later ones, and asymmetric tradeoffs whereby the gain/loss ratio of the new/old activity decreased 400-fold from the beginning of the trajectory to its end. We describe the molecular basis for these phenomena and suggest they have an important role in shaping natural proteins. These findings also suggest that the catalytic efficiency and specificity of many natural enzymes may be far from their optimum.},

	Abstract = {A fitness landscape relates the genotype of an organism to its reproductive capacity and therefore has a central role in evolutionary biology.Introduced in the 1930s, the fitness landscape concept has long been used primarily as a metaphor. This has recently changed, as new experimental tools allow the systematic construction and analysis of combinations of predefined sets of genetic mutations.The topography of the fitness landscape is determined by how different mutations interact in their effect on fitness. A particular type of epistasis known as sign epistasis causes the fitness landscape to be rugged, possibly with multiple peaks.A survey of experimental studies shows that most empirical fitness landscapes are rugged, but the amount of ruggedness varies systematically depending on the way the mutations that form the landscape have been chosen.On rugged fitness landscapes, the accessibility of mutational pathways towards higher fitness is reduced, which makes the evolutionary process more constrained and hence predictable. In addition, predictability depends on population size in ways that can be explored using mathematical modelling.A key challenge for the future is to extend current fitness landscape studies to genome-wide scales and to develop models that are informed by the interactions of biomolecules.},

In principle, evolution to this high-resistance β-lactamase might follow any of the 120 mutational trajectories linking these alleles. However, we demonstrate that 102 trajectories are inaccessible to Darwinian selection and that many of the remaining trajectories have negligible probabilities of realization, because four of these five mutations fail to increase drug resistance in some combinations. Pervasive biophysical pleiotropy within the β-lactamase seems to be responsible, and because such pleiotropy appears to be a general property of missense mutations, we conclude that much protein evolution will be similarly constrained. This implies that the protein tape of life may be largely reproducible and even predictable.},

	N2 = {In an attempt to understand whether it should be expected that some genes tend to be used disproportionately often by natural selection, we investigated two related phenomena: the evolution of flux control among enzymes in a metabolic pathway and properties of adaptive substitutions in pathway enzymes. These two phenomena are related by the principle that adaptive substitutions should occur more frequently in enzymes with greater flux control. Predicting which enzymes will be preferentially involved in adaptive evolution thus requires an evolutionary theory of flux control. We investigated the evolution of enzyme control in metabolic pathways with two models of enzyme kinetics: metabolic control theory (MCT) and Michaelis--Menten saturation kinetics (SK). Our models generate two main predictions for pathways in which reactions are moderately to highly irreversible: (1) flux control will evolve to be highly unequal among enzymes in a pathway and (2) upstream enzymes evolve a greater control coefficient then those downstream. This results in upstream enzymes fixing the majority of beneficial mutations during adaptive evolution. Once the population has reached high fitness, the trend is reversed, with the majority of neutral/slightly deleterious mutations occurring in downstream enzymes. These patterns are the result of three factors (the first of these is unique to the MCT simulations while the other two seem to be general properties of the metabolic pathways): (1) the majority of randomly selected, starting combinations of enzyme kinetic rates generate pathways that possess greater control for the upstream enzymes compared to downstream enzymes; (2) selection against large pools of intermediate substrates tends to prevent majority control by downstream enzymes; and (3) equivalent mutations in enzyme kinetic rates have the greatest effect on flux for enzymes with high levels of flux control, and these enzymes will accumulate adaptive substitutions, strengthening their control. Prediction 1 is well supported by available data on control coefficients. Data for evaluating prediction 2 are sparse but not inconsistent with this prediction.},

@article{Rodrigues16,
	Abstract = {Fitness landscapes of drug resistance constitute powerful tools to elucidate mutational pathways of antibiotic escape. Here, we developed a predictive biophysics-based fitness landscape of trimethoprim (TMP) resistance for Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). We investigated the activity, binding, folding stability, and intracellular abundance for a complete set of combinatorial DHFR mutants made out of three key resistance mutations and extended this analysis to DHFR originated from Chlamydia muridarum and Listeria grayi We found that the acquisition of TMP resistance via decreased drug affinity is limited by a trade-off in catalytic efficiency. Protein stability is concurrently affected by the resistant mutants, which precludes a precise description of fitness from a single molecular trait. Application of the kinetic flux theory provided an accurate model to predict resistance phenotypes (IC50) quantitatively from a unique combination of the in vitro protein molecular properties. Further, we found that a controlled modulation of the GroEL/ES chaperonins and Lon protease levels affects the intracellular steady-state concentration of DHFR in a mutation-specific manner, whereas IC50 is changed proportionally, as indeed predicted by the model. This unveils a molecular rationale for the pleiotropic role of the protein quality control machinery on the evolution of antibiotic resistance, which, as we illustrate here, may drastically confound the evolutionary outcome. These results provide a comprehensive quantitative genotype-phenotype map for the essential enzyme that serves as an important target of antibiotic and anticancer therapies.},

	Abstract = {In this report, UbiE and UbiH in the quinone modification pathway (QMP) were identified in addition to UbiG as bottleneck enzymes in the CoQ10 biosynthesis by Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The CoQ10 content was enhanced after co-overexpression of UbiE and UbiG, however, accompanied by the accumulation of the intermediate 10P-MMBQ. UbiH was then co-overexpressed to pull the metabolic flux towards downstream, resulting in an elevated CoQ10 productivity and decreased biomass. On the other hand, the expression levels of UbiE and UbiG were tuned to eliminate the intermediate accumulation, however at the sacrifice of productivity. To alleviate the detrimental effect on either productivity or cell growth, we tried to fuse UbiG with UbiE and localize them onto the membrane to elevate intermediate conversion.

However, attempts to date have only resulted in low levels of isoflavone accumulation in non-legumes. Introducing soybean isoflavone synthase (IFS) into Arabidopsis thaliana leads to accumulation of low levels of genistein glycosides. Leaves of wild-type A. thaliana contain high levels of similar conjugates of the flavonols quercetin and kaempferol, which could be increased by threefold on introduction of an alfalfa chalcone isomerase transgene. Levels of genistein were not increased by expressing both IFS and alfalfa chalcone isomerase, but levels of flavonol conjugates were reduced to a greater extent than could be accounted for by flux into isoflavone. Introduction of IFS into the tt6/tt3 double mutant blocked in flavonol, and anthocyanin synthesis resulted in high levels of genistein. The bottleneck for constitutive isoflavone production in Arabidopsis is, therefore, competition for flavanone between IFS and endogenous flavonol synthesis, and the flavonol pathway is reciprocally but disproportionately affected by IFS.

For pathways, we seek not only to decide whether they are feasible but also to pinpoint the pathway segment that causes any thermodynamic difficulties. We define a set of scaled quantities which reformulate the thermodynamic-feasibility problem for the whole pathway. We present an algorithm which analyzes individual reactions and selective construction of larger subpathways and uncovers localized and distributed thermodynamic bottlenecks of the biotransformation. This type of thermodynamic treatment contributes to the effort to include more physical, chemical, and biological factors in the computer-aided analysis of metabolic pathways.},

Force-field based methods have now been used to engineer both enzyme specificity and activity. However, the proportion of designed mutants with the intended function is often less than ten percent. One potential reason for this is that current force-field based approaches are trained on indirect measures of function rather than direct correlation to experimentally-determined functional effects of mutations. We hypothesize that this is partially due to the lack of data sets for which a large panel of enzyme variants has been produced, purified, and kinetically characterized. Here we report the kcat and KM values of 100 purified mutants of a glycoside hydrolase enzyme. We demonstrate the utility of this data set by using machine learning to train a new algorithm that enables prediction of each kinetic parameter based on readily-modeled structural features. The generated dataset and analyses carried out in this study not only provide insight into how this enzyme functions, they also provide a clear path forward for the improvement of computational enzyme redesign algorithms.},

However, recreating such processes in the laboratory has been met with only moderate success. What are the factors that lead to suboptimal research outputs? In this review, we discuss constraints on enzyme evolution, which can restrict evolutionary trajectories and lead to evolutionary dead-ends. We highlight recent studies that have used experimental evolution to mimic different aspects of enzymatic adaptation under simple, controlled settings to shed light on evolutionary dynamics and constraints. A better understanding of these constraints will lead to the development of more efficient strategies for directed evolution and enzyme engineering.},

	Abstract = {In mammalian cells, nucleoside transport usually is mediated by facilitated diffusion. In addition, a Na(+)-dependent, concentrative nucleoside transport system has been detected in several tissues but not the liver. To further clarify hepatic nucleoside transport mechanisms, we measured the uptake of [2-14C]uridine (2 to 100 mumol/L) and of [8-14C]adenosine (10 to 75 mumol/L) by the isolated perfused rat liver in the presence or absence of extracellular sodium or specific inhibitors of facilitated nucleoside diffusion. Uridine transport and metabolism were monitored by the release of labeled catabolites including 14CO2, which indicated complete degradation of the pyrimidine. Adenosine, uridine and uridine catabolites were measured in the effluent perfusate by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and a radioactivity flow monitor. The existence of a Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transport system could be inferred from the following observations: (a) Sodium depletion caused a strong inhibition of nucleoside transport reflected by an up to threefold and 15-fold increase in extracellular uridine and adenosine, respectively. The sodium-dependent transport of uridine was saturated when the influent uridine concentration was raised beyond 20 mumol/L. No such saturation was observed for much higher concentrations of adenosine used (10 to 75 mumol/L). (b) Na(+)-free perfusion resulted in a strong suppression of the release of uridine catabolites by the liver. Complete uridine breakdown was depressed to 7% of the amount of 14CO2 released in the presence of sodium and at influent uridine concentrations below 20 mumol/L. (c) Inhibition of uridine (10 mumol/L) transport and degradation was observed after coperfusion with adenosine, deoxyadenosine, guanosine and deoxyguanosine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {The uptake of a substrate that is transported into the cell by facilitated diffusion and subsequently converted in a series of enzymatic reactions, measured as a function of the external concentration, does not usually show the rectangular hyperbolic function characteristic of Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Instead, a seemingly biphasic curve is observed, consisting of Michaelis-Menten kinetics at low concentrations and no further uptake at higher levels. By combining the equations for facilitated diffusion and an enzymatic reaction, we have derived an equation that describes the overall rate of uptake and metabolism of a substrate that is transported across the plasma membrane by facilitated diffusion. Modelling based on this equation simulated the kinetics found experimentally, as long as the kinetic parameters of the carrier were chosen to render it asymmetric. The overall rate was influenced by the kinetics of both reactions over a wide range of concentrations, confirming the principles of the `Control Analysis'theory in an independent manner.},

Using toy models that exemplify different metabolic pathway scenarios, we show that substrate competition can influence the dynamics and the steady state concentrations of a metabolic pathway. We have additionally derived rate laws for substrate competition in reversible reactions and summarise existing rate laws for substrate competition in irreversible reactions.},

	Abstract = {Publisher Summary Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a creature adapted to its ecological niche. This chapter examines several aspects of its fitness for survival in the lower intestine and has shown that E. coli is designed for efficient growth in its high viscosity habitat with its sporadic nutrient input. Effective use of resources to produce functioning organisms implies that macromolecular synthesis is properly divided between structural and enzymic units on one hand and the means of production that include ribosomes and t-RNA on the other. In an expanding economy all elements must increase, but the manufacture of means of production themselves must be more sensitively geared to the rate of expansion than to the actual quantity of goods produced. E. coli are not constructed to be efficient at allocating resources for nucleic acid and protein synthesis from the point of view of an ideal, non-fluctuating continuous culture. An analysis of the efficiency of the transport machinery that allows E. coli to compete with its neighbors for carbon and nitrogen sources, growth factors, or trace elements is presented. It is concluded that the transport mechanisms for several compounds have evolved to the degree where diffusion through the viscous natural environment is limiting.},

	Abstract = {There are living prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) that have cell sizes that range from 0.02-400 microns3. Over this tremendous range, various abilities to cope with the environment are needed. This review attempts to formulate some of the problems and some of the solutions. The smallest size for a free-living organism is suggested to be largely set by the catalytic efficiency of enzymes and protein synthetic machinery. Because of fluctuations in the environment, cells must maintain machinery to cope with various catastrophes; these mechanisms increase the minimum size of the cell. On the other hand, the largest cell is reasonably assumed to be limited by the ability of diffusion to bring nutrients to the appropriate part of the cell and to dispose of waste products. To explore the limitation imposed by diffusion, analysis is developed of diffusion processes through stirred and unstirred media, diffusion through media that contains obstacles, and the effect of size and shape.},

Since that time, a tremendous amount of work has clarified the intricate details of the prosthetic groups, cofactors and proteins that comprise the respiratory chain and associated machinery for ATP synthesis. The work has culminated in advanced crystallographic and spectroscopic methods that provide structural and mechanistic details of this mitochondrial molecular machinery, in many instances to atomic level. I review here the current state of understanding of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in terms of structures and dynamics of the component proteins and their roles in the biological electron and proton transfer processes that result in ATP synthesis. These advances, together with emerging evidence of further diverse roles of mitochondria in health and disease, have prompted a new era of interest in mitochondrial function.},

@article{Xie04,
	Abstract = {NupG from Escherichia coli is the archetype of a family of nucleoside transporters found in several eubacterial groups and has distant homologues in eukaryotes, including man. To facilitate investigation of its molecular mechanism, we developed methods for expressing an oligohistidine-tagged form of NupG both at high levels (>20% of the inner membrane protein) in E. coli and in Xenopus laevis oocytes. In E. coli recombinant NupG transported purine (adenosine) and pyrimidine (uridine) nucleosides with apparent K(m) values of approximately 20-30 microM and transport was energized primarily by the membrane potential component of the proton motive force. Competition experiments in E. coli and measurements of uptake in oocytes confirmed that NupG was a broad-specificity transporter of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. Importantly, using high-level expression in E. coli and magic-angle spinning cross-polarization solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, we have for the first time been able directly to measure the binding of the permeant ([1'-(13)C]uridine) to the protein and to assess its relative mobility within the binding site, under non-energized conditions. Purification of over-expressed NupG to near homogeneity by metal chelate affinity chromatography, with retention of transport function in reconstitution assays, was also achieved. Fourier transform infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopy provided further evidence that the purified protein retained its 3D conformation and was predominantly alpha-helical in nature, consistent with a proposed structure containing 12 transmembrane helices. These findings open the way to elucidating the molecular mechanism of transport in this key family of membrane transporters.},

@article{Chakrabarti94,
	Abstract = {The amino acid permeability of membranes is of interest because they are one of the key solutes involved in cell function. Membrane permeability coefficients (P) for amino acid classes, including neutral, polar, hydrophobic, and charged species, have been measured and compared using a variety of techniques. Decreasing lipid chain length increased permeability slightly (5-fold), while variations in pH had only minor effects on the permeability coefficients of the amino acids tested in liposomes. Increasing the membrane surface charge increased the permeability of amino acids of the opposite charge, while increasing the cholesterol content decreased membrane permeability. The permeability coefficients for most amino acids tested were surprisingly similar to those previously measured for monovalent cations such as sodium and potassium (approximately 10(-12)-10(-13) cm · s(-1)). This observation suggests that the permeation rates for the neutral, polar and charged amino acids are controlled by bilayer fluctuations and transient defects, rather than partition coefficients and Born energy barriers. Hydrophobic amino acids were 10(2) more permeable than the hydrophilic forms, reflecting their increased partition coefficient values.External pH had dramatic effects on the permeation rates for the modified amino acid lysine methyl ester in response to transmembrane pH gradients. It was established that lysine methyl ester and other modified short peptides permeate rapidly (P = 10(-2) cm · s(-1)) as neutral (deprotonated) molecules. It was also shown that charge distributions dramatically alter permeation rates for modified di-peptides. These results may relate to the movement of peptides through membranes during protein translocation and to the origin of cellular membrane transport on the early Earth.},

	Abstract = {Studies of Escherichia coli under competition for lactose in chemostat cultures have been used to determine the selective effects of variation in the level of the beta-galactoside permease and the beta-galactosidase enzyme. The results determine the adaptive topography of these gene products relative to growth in limiting lactose and enable predictions concerning the selective effects of genetic variants found in natural populations. In the terms of metabolic control theory, the beta-galactosidase enzyme at wild-type-induced levels has a small control coefficient with respect to fitness (C = 0.018), and hence genetic variants resulting in minor changes in enzyme activity have disproportionately small effects on fitness. However, the apparent control coefficient of the beta-galactoside permease at wild-type-induced levels is large (C = 0.551), and hence even minor changes in activity affect fitness. Therefore, we predict that genetic polymorphisms in the lacZ gene are subject to less effective selection in natural populations than are those in the lacY gene. The beta-galactoside permease is also less efficient than might be expected, and possible forces resulting in selection for an intermediate optimum level of permease activity are considered. The selective forces that maintain the lactose operon in a regulated state in natural populations are also discussed.},

@article{Hartl85,
	Abstract = {Many enzymes in intermediary metabolism manifest saturation kinetics in which flux is a concave function of enzyme activity and often of the Michaelis-Menten form. The result is that, when natural selection favors increased enzyme activity so as to maximize flux, a point of diminishing returns will be attained in which any increase in flux results in a disproportionately small increase in fitness. Enzyme activity ultimately will reach a level at which the favorable effect of an increase in activity is of the order 1/(4Ne) or smaller, where Ne is the effective population number. At this point, many mutations that result in small changes in activity will result in negligible changes in fitness and will be selectively nearly neutral. We propose that this process is a mechanism whereby conditions for the occurrence of nearly neutral mutations and gene substitutions can be brought about by the long-continued action of natural selection. Evidence for the hypothesis derives from metabolic theory, direct studies of flux, studies of null and other types of alleles in Drosophila melanogaster and chemostat studies in Escherichia coli. Limitations and complications of the theory include changes in environment or genetic background, enzymes with sharply defined optima of activity, overdominance, pleiotropy, multifunctional enzymes and branched metabolic pathways. We conclude that the theory is a useful synthesis that unites many seemingly unrelated observations. The principal theoretical conclusion is that the conditions for the occurrence of neutral evolution can be brought about as an indirect result of the action of natural selection.},

Contents of the database range from cell sizes to metabolite concentrations, from reaction rates to generation times, from genome sizes to the number of mitochondria in a cell. While always of importance to biologists, having numbers in hand is becoming increasingly critical for experimenting, modeling, and analyzing biological systems. BioNumbers was motivated by an appreciation of how long it can take to find even the simplest number in the vast biological literature. All numbers are taken directly from a literature source and that reference is provided with the number. BioNumbers is designed to be highly searchable and queries can be performed by keywords or browsed by menus. BioNumbers is a collaborative community platform where registered users can add content and make comments on existing data. All new entries and commentary are curated to maintain high quality.

	Abstract = {How microbes dynamically coordinate uptake and simultaneous utilization of nutrients in complex nutritional ecosystems is still an open question. Here, we develop a constraint-based modeling approach that exploits non-targeted exo-metabolomics data to unravel adaptive decision-making processes in dynamic nutritional environments. We thereby investigate metabolic adaptation of Escherichia coli to continuously changing conditions during batch growth in complex medium. Unexpectedly, model-based analysis of time resolved exo-metabolome data revealed that fastest growth coincides with preferred catabolism of amino acids, which, in turn, reduces glucose uptake and increases acetate overflow. We show that high intracellular levels of the amino acid degradation metabolites pyruvate and oxaloacetate can directly inhibit the phosphotransferase system (PTS), and reveal their functional role in mediating regulatory decisions for uptake and catabolism of alternative carbon sources. Overall, the proposed methodology expands the spectrum of possible applications of flux balance analysis to decipher metabolic adaptation mechanisms in naturally occurring habitats and diverse organisms.},

	Abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells exhibiting high-affinity glucose transport, the glucose consumption rate at extracellular concentrations above 10 mM was only half of the zero trans-influx rate. To determine if this regulation of glucose transport might be a consequence of intracellular free glucose we developed a new method to measure intracellular glucose concentrations in cells metabolizing glucose, which compares glucose stereoisomers to correct for adhering glucose. The intracellular glucose concentration was 1.5 mM, much higher than in most earlier reports. We show that for the simplest model of a glucose carrier, this concentration is sufficient to reduce the glucose influx by 50{\%}. We conclude that intracellular glucose is the most likely candidate for the observed regulation of glucose import and hence glycolysis. We discuss the possibility that intracellular glucose functions as a primary signal molecule in these cells.},

@article{Bosdriesz18,
	Abstract = {Many organisms have several similar transporters with different affinities for the same substrate. Typically, high-affinity transporters are expressed when substrate is scarce and low-affinity ones when it is abundant. The benefit of using low instead of high-affinity transporters remains unclear, especially when additional nutrient sensors are present. Here, we investigate two hypotheses. It was previously hypothesized that there is a trade-off between the affinity and the catalytic efficiency of transporters, and we find some but no definitive support for it. Additionally, we propose that for uptake by facilitated diffusion, at saturating substrate concentrations, lowering the affinity enhances the net uptake rate by reducing substrate efflux. As a consequence, there exists an optimal, external-substrate-concentration dependent transporter affinity. A computational model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycolysis shows that using the low affinity HXT3 transporter instead of the high affinity HXT6 enhances the steady-state flux by 36{\%}. We tried to test this hypothesis with yeast strains expressing a single glucose transporter modified to have either a high or a low affinity. However, due to the intimate link between glucose perception and metabolism, direct experimental proof for this hypothesis remained inconclusive. Still, our theoretical results provide a novel reason for the presence of low-affinity transport systems.},

	Abstract = {An expression relating the mobilities of the free (DC) and the loaded (DCS) carrier was derived and two kinetic tests based on it were applied to monosaccharide transport in baker's yeast: (1) comparison of the Michaelis constant of transport (KT) with the dissociation constant of the sugar-carrier complex KCS); (2) comparison of the initial rate of exit of a labelled sugar into a sugar-free medium with that into an equilibrium concentration of non-labelled sugar. Although the movement of the carrier across the membrane appears to be the limiting step of the transport process, the mobilities of the free and the loaded carrier were found to differ. For monosaccharides transported into the entire cell-water volume (represented by d-glucose, d-fructose, d-xylose and d-arabinose) DCS/DC = 1.9--3.5, whereas for sugars transported into only a part of the cell water (represented by d-galactose and d-ribose) DCS/DC = 1. The results (1) serve as further evidence for the existence of two carrier types in baker's yeast and (2) indicate that the simplified theory of carrier transport is not applicable to baker's yeast.},

@article{Elbing04,
	Abstract = {The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae predominantly ferments glucose to ethanol at high external glucose concentrations, irrespective of the presence of oxygen. In contrast, at low external glucose concentrations and in the presence of oxygen, as in a glucose-limited chemostat, no ethanol is produced. The importance of the external glucose concentration suggests a central role for the affinity and maximal transport rates of yeast{\textquoteright}s glucose transporters in the control of ethanol production. Here we present a series of strains producing functional chimeras between the hexose transporters Hxt1 and Hxt7, each of which has distinct glucose transport characteristics. The strains display a range of decreasing glycolytic rates resulting in a proportional decrease in ethanol production. Using these strains, we show for the first time that at high glucose levels, the glucose uptake capacity of wild-type S. cerevisiae does not control glycolytic flux during exponential batch growth. In contrast, our chimeric Hxt transporters control the rate of glycolysis to a high degree. Strains whose glucose uptake is mediated by these chimeric transporters will undoubtedly provide a powerful tool with which to examine in detail the mechanism underlying the switch between fermentation and respiration in S. cerevisiae and will provide new tools for the control of industrial fermentations.},

	Abstract = {By using a modified technique to measure glucose uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, potential uncertainties have been identified in previous determinations. These previous determinations had led to the proposal that S. cerevisiae contained a constitutive low-affinity glucose transporter and a glucose-repressible high-affinity transporter. We show that, upon transition from glucose-repressed to -derepressed conditions, the maximum rate of glucose transport is constant and only the affinity for glucose changes. We conclude that the transporter or group of transporters is constitutive and that regulation of glucose transport occurs via a factor that modifies the affinity of the transporters and not via the synthesis of different kinetically independent transporters. Such a mechanism could, for instance, be accommodated by the binding of kinases causing a change in affinity for glucose.},

	Abstract = {{The yeast glucose transporters Hxt1, Hxt2, Hxt3, Hxt4, Hxt6, Hxt7 and Gal2, individually expressed in an hxt1-7 null mutant strain, demonstrate the phenomenon of countertransport. Thus, these transporters, which are the most important glucose transporters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are facilitated diffusion transporters. Apparent Km-values from high to low affinity, determined from countertransport and initial-uptake experiments, respectively, are: Hxt6 0.9$\pm$0.2 and 1.4$\pm$0.1 mM, Hxt7 1.3$\pm$0.3 and 1.9$\pm$0.1 mM, Gal2 1.5 and 1.6$\pm$0.1 mM, Hxt2 2.9$\pm$0.3 and 4.6$\pm$0.3 mM, Hxt4 6.2$\pm$0.5 and 6.2$\pm$0.3 mM, Hxt3 28.6$\pm$6.8 and 34.2$\pm$3.2 mM, and Hxt1 107$\pm$49 and 129$\pm$9 mM. From both independent methods, countertransport and initial uptake, the same range of apparent Km-values was obtained for each transporter. In contrast to that in human erythrocytes, the facilitated diffusion transport mechanism of glucose in yeast was symmetric. Besides facilitated diffusion there existed in all single glucose transport mutants, except for the HXT1 strain, significant first-order behaviour.}},

	Abstract = {The effect of macromolecular crowding on diffusion beyond the hard-core sphere model is studied. A new coarse-grained model is presented{,} the Chain Entanglement Softened Potential (CESP) model{,} which takes into account the macromolecular flexibility and chain entanglement. The CESP model uses a shoulder-shaped interaction potential that is implemented in the Brownian Dynamics (BD) computations. The interaction potential contains only one parameter associated with the chain entanglement energetic cost (Ur). The hydrodynamic interactions are included in the BD computations via Tokuyama mean-field equations. The model is used to analyze the diffusion of a streptavidin protein among different sized dextran obstacles. For this system{,} Ur is obtained by fitting the streptavidin experimental long-time diffusion coefficient Dlongversus the macromolecular concentration for D50 (indicating their molecular weight in kg mol−1) dextran obstacles. The obtained Dlong values show better quantitative agreement with experiments than those obtained with hard-core spheres. Moreover{,} once parametrized{,} the CESP model is also able to quantitatively predict Dlong and the anomalous exponent (α) for streptavidin diffusion among D10{,} D400 and D700 dextran obstacles. Dlong{,} the short-time diffusion coefficient (Dshort) and α are obtained from the BD simulations by using a new empirical expression{,} able to describe the full temporal evolution of the diffusion coefficient.},

	Abstract = {Macromolecular crowding in biological media is an essential factor for cellular function. The interplay of intermolecular interactions at multiple time and length scales governs a fine-tuned system of reaction and transport processes, including particularly protein diffusion as a limiting or driving factor. Using quasielastic neutron backscattering, we probe the protein self-diffusion in crowded aqueous solutions of bovine serum albumin on nanosecond time and nanometer length scales employing the same protein as crowding agent. The measured diffusion coefficient D(φ) strongly decreases with increasing protein volume fraction φ explored within 7\%~<=~φ~<=~30\%. With an ellipsoidal protein model and an analytical framework involving colloid diffusion theory, we separate the rotational Dr(φ) and translational Dt(φ) contributions to D(φ). The resulting Dt(φ) is described by short-time self-diffusion of effective spheres. Protein self-diffusion at biological volume fractions is found to be slowed down to 20\% of the dilute limit solely due to hydrodynamic interactions.},

@article{Han93,
	Abstract = {The effects of crowding on the self or tracer diffusion of macromolecules in concentrated solutions is an important but difficult problem, for which, so far, there has been no rigorous treatment. Muramatsu and Minton suggested a simple model to calculate the diffusion coefficient of a hard sphere among other hard spheres. In this treatment, scaled particle theory is used to evaluate the probability that the target volume for a step in a random walk is free of any macromolecules. We have improved this approach by using a more appropriate target volume which also allows the calculation to be extended to the diffusion of a hard sphere among hard spherocylinders. We conclude that, to the extent that proteins can be approximated as hard particles, the hindrance of globular proteins by other proteins is reduced when the background proteins aggregate (the more so the greater the decrease in particle surface area), the hindrance due to rod-shaped background particles is reduced slightly if the rod-like particles are aligned, and the anisotropy of the diffusion of soluble proteins among cytoskeletal proteins will normally be small.},

@article{Fisch85,
	Abstract = {{$[$}The paper attempts to elucidate and evaluate William Whewell's notion of a "consilience of inductions." In section I Whewellian consilience is defined and shown to differ considerably from what latter-day writers talk about when they use the term. In section II a primary analysis of consilience is shown to yield two types of consilient processes, one in which one of the lower-level laws undergoes a conceptual change (the case aptly discussed in Butts {$[$}1977{$]$}), and one in which the explanatory theory undergoes conceptual "stretching." In section III both consilient cases are compared to the non-consilient case in reference to L. J. Cohen's method of relevant variables. In section IV we examine the test procedures of the theory in all three cases, and it is shown that in the event of genuine consilience (consilience of the second type) a theory acquires extraordinarily high support. In the final section something is said of the short-comings of standard Bayesian confirmation theories that are highlighted by Whewellian consilience.{$]$}},

Furthermore, there is need for specific growth rate (μ) dependent absolute quantitative transcriptome and proteome data to understand the molecular relationships for enabling cells to modify μ. We address these questions, for the first time, by presenting regulatory strategies for more efficient metabolism of Escherichia coli at higher μby statistical covariance analysis of genome-wide intracellular mRNA and protein concentrations coupled to metabolic flux analysis in the steady state range of μ= 0.11--0.49 h−1. Our analyses show dominating post-transcriptional control of protein abundances and post-translational control of flux rates. On average, E. coli achieved five-times faster growth through 3.7-fold increase of apparent catalytic rates of enzymes (kapp) and 2.5-fold increased translation rates, demonstrating the relevance of post-translational regulation for increasing flux throughput. Interestingly, pathways carrying the highest flux showed both high protein abundance and kapp values. Furthermore, co-regulation analysis of enzymatic capacities revealed tightly coupled regulatory dependencies of protein synthesis and RNA precursor synthesis, substrate utilization, biosynthetic and energy generation pathways carrying the highest flux. We also observed metabolic pathway and COG specific protein and metabolic flux control levels, protein expression costs and genome-wide principles for translation efficiency and transcription unit polarity. This work contributes to the much needed quantitative understanding of coordinated gene expression regulation and metabolic flux control. Our findings will also advance modeling and metabolic engineering of industrial strains.},

	Abstract = {A significant goal in the post-genome era is to relate the annotated genome sequence to the physiological functions of a cell. Working from the annotated genome sequence, as well as biochemical and physiological information, it is possible to reconstruct complete metabolic networks. Furthermore, computational methods have been developed to interpret and predict the optimal performance of a metabolic network under a range of growth conditions. We have tested the hypothesis that Escherichia coli uses its metabolism to grow at a maximal rate using the E. coli MG1655 metabolic reconstruction. Based on this hypothesis, we formulated experiments that describe the quantitative relationship between a primary carbon source (acetate or succinate) uptake rate, oxygen uptake rate, and maximal cellular growth rate. We found that the experimental data were consistent with the stated hypothesis, namely that the E. coli metabolic network is optimized to maximize growth under the experimental conditions considered. This study thus demonstrates how the combination of in silico and experimental biology can be used to obtain a quantitative genotype--phenotype relationship for metabolism in bacterial cells.},

However, the current use of kcat presents major difficulties, as values for most enzymes have not been experimentally measured, and experimentally available values are often measured under nonphysiological conditions, thereby casting doubt on the relevance of kcat under in vivo conditions. We present an approach that utilizes omics data to quantitatively analyze the relationship between in vitro kcat values and the maximal catalytic rate of enzymes in vivo. Our approach offers a high-throughput method to obtain enzyme kinetic constants, which reflect in vivo conditions, and are useful for more accurate and complete cellular metabolic models.Turnover numbers, also known as kcat values, are fundamental properties of enzymes. However, kcat data are scarce and measured in vitro, thus may not faithfully represent the in vivo situation. A basic question that awaits elucidation is: how representative are kcat values for the maximal catalytic rates of enzymes in vivo? Here, we harness omics data to calculate kmaxvivo, the observed maximal catalytic rate of an enzyme inside cells. Comparison with kcat values from Escherichia coli, yields a correlation of r2= 0.62 in log scale (p \&lt; 10−10), with a root mean square difference of 0.54 (3.5-fold in linear scale), indicating that in vivo and in vitro maximal rates generally concur. By accounting for the degree of saturation of enzymes and the backward flux dictated by thermodynamics, we further refine the correspondence between kmaxvivo and kcat values. The approach we present here characterizes the quantitative relationship between enzymatic catalysis in vitro and in vivo and offers a high-throughput method for extracting enzyme kinetic constants from omics data.},

However, variation in trade-offs is often determined at the molecular level, outside the scope of conventional ecological inquiry. In this study, we propose that understanding the intracellular basis for trade-offs in microbial systems can aid in predicting and interpreting patterns of diversity. First, we show how laboratory experiments and mathematical models have unveiled the hidden intracellular mechanisms underlying trade-offs key to microbial diversity: (i) metabolic and regulatory trade-offs in bacteria and yeast; (ii) life-history trade-offs in bacterial viruses. Next, we examine recent studies of marine microbes that have taken steps toward reconciling the molecular and the ecological views of trade-offs, despite the challenges in doing so in natural settings. Finally, we suggest avenues for research where mathematical modelling, experiments and studies of natural microbial communities provide a unique opportunity to integrate studies of diversity across multiple scales.},

Basically, in the existing methods, there are two kinds of models, the Alberty-Hammes-Eigen model and the Chou model, for calculating the upper limit of enzyme reaction. In this paper, an analysis and comparison between these two models are made. It is pointed out that the magnitude of the van der Waals' binding energy between enzyme and substrate molecules will play a key role in deciding whether there is a significant difference or not for the results calculated from these two models. Through such a comparison, the role of the major protein outside the active site of an enzyme molecule also becomes obvious: if the van der Waals' binding energy is very small, the major protein will act like a ?wall?, blocking the flow of some substrate molecules to the active site; while if the van der Waals' energy is greater than 3 kT (where k is the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature), the major protein will behave like a ?accelerator?, speeding up the flow of the substrate molecules to the active site around the enzyme molecule.},

@article{Klipp94,
	Abstract = {The distribution of the kinetic parameters of enzymic reactions is theoretically studied, on the assumption that, during evolution, the increase of reaction rates was an important target of natural selection. In extension of previous work on the optimization of enzyme kinetic parameters, the influence of constraints concerning upper limits of the individual rate constants is analyzed. The concept of "evolutionary effort" is applied to derive an expression for the cost function, leading to an overall upper limit for the values of the rate constants. The resulting optimization problem is solved for ordered mechanisms involving different numbers of elementary steps. It is shown that the optimum for the enzyme kinetic parameters strongly depends on the concentrations of the reactants. Low reactant concentrations lead generally to a tight binding of the reactants, while high concentrations result in a weak binding, favouring the rate constants of the other steps. In particular, states of maximum activity are not always characterized by maximal values of second-order rate constants. The results support the hypothesis that there is a mutual adaptation of Michaelis constants and reactant concentrations in an evolutionary timescale. In the limit of infinite values of the exponent of the cost function the results of the present "overall limit model" turn into the results of a model which takes into account individual upper limits for rate constants ("separate limit model"). The distributions of optimal rate constants are discussed in terms of free-energy profiles. The model is applied to the interpretation of the kinetic data of triosephosphate isomerase and inorganic pyrophosphatase.},

@article{Olson-Manning12,
	Abstract = {Network characteristics of biochemical pathways are believed to influence the rate of evolutionary change in constituent enzymes. One characteristic that may affect rate heterogeneity is control of the amount of product produced by a biochemical pathway or flux control. In particular, theoretical analyses suggest that adaptive substitutions should be concentrated in the enzyme(s) that exert the greatest control over flux. Although a handful of studies have found a correlation between position in a pathway and evolutionary rate, these investigations have not examined the relationship between evolutionary rate and flux control. Given that genes with greater control will experience stronger selection and that the probability of fixation is proportional to the selective advantage, we ask the following: 1) do upstream enzymes have majority flux control, 2) do enzymes with majority flux control accumulate adaptive substitutions, and 3) are upstream enzymes under higher selective constraint? First, by perturbing the enzymes in the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana with gene insertion lines, we show that flux control is focused in the first enzyme in the pathway. Next, by analyzing several sequence signatures of selection, we also show that this enzyme is the only one in the pathway that shows convincing evidence of selection. Our results support the hypothesis that natural selection preferentially acts on enzymes with high flux control.},

@article{Greenberg08,
	Abstract = {Organisms must carefully control their metabolism in order to survive. On the other hand, enzymes must adapt in response to evolutionary pressures on the pathways in which they are imbedded. Taking advantage of the newly available whole-genome sequences of 12 Drosophila species, we examined how protein function and metabolic network architecture influence rates of enzyme evolution. We found that despite high overall constraint, there were significant differences in rates of amino acid substitution among functional classes of enzymes. This heterogeneity arises because proteins involved in the metabolism of foreign compounds evolve relatively rapidly, whereas enzymes that act in ``core''metabolism exhibit much slower rates of amino acid replacement, suggesting strong selective constraint. Network architecture also influences enzymes'rates of amino acid replacement. In particular, enzymes that share metabolites with many other enzymes are relatively constrained, although apparently not because they are more likely to be essential. Our analyses suggest that this pattern is driven by strong constraint of enzymes acting at branch points in metabolic pathways. We conclude that metabolic network architecture and enzyme function separately affect enzyme evolution rates.},

The core database provides a comprehensive overview on enzymes. A collection of 4.3 million data for ∼84 000 enzymes manually evaluated and extracted from ∼140 000 primary literature references is combined with information obtained by text and data mining, data integration and prediction algorithms. Supplements comprise disease-related data, protein sequences, 3D structures, predicted enzyme locations and genome annotations. Major developments are a revised ligand summary page and the structure search now including a similarity and isomer search. BKMS-react, an integrated database containing known enzyme-catalyzed reactions, is supplemented with further reactions and improved access to pathway connections. In addition to existing enzyme word maps with graphical information of enzyme specific terms, plant word maps have been developed. They show a graphical overview of terms, e.g. enzyme or plant pathogen information, connected to specific plants. An organism summary page showing all relevant information, e.g. taxonomy and synonyms linked to enzyme data, was implemented. Based on a decision by the IUBMB enzyme task force the enzyme class EC 7 has been established for `translocases', enzymes that catalyze a transport of ions or metabolites across cellular membranes.},

Compared to other lineages, the evolution of multicellularity in fungi follows different principles; both simple and complex multicellularity evolved via unique mechanisms not found in other lineages. Herein we review ecological, palaeontological, developmental and genomic aspects of complex multicellularity in fungi and discuss general principles of the evolution of complex multicellularity in light of its fungal manifestations. Fungi represent the only lineage in which complex multicellularity shows signatures of convergent evolution: it appears 8?11 times in distinct fungal lineages, which show a patchy phylogenetic distribution yet share some of the genetic mechanisms underlying complex multicellular development. To explain the patchy distribution of complex multicellularity across the fungal phylogeny we identify four key observations: the large number of apparently independent complex multicellular clades; the lack of documented phenotypic homology between these clades; the conservation of gene circuits regulating the onset of complex multicellular development; and the existence of clades in which the evolution of complex multicellularity is coupled with limited gene family diversification. We discuss how these patterns and known genetic aspects of fungal development can be reconciled with the genetic theory of convergent evolution to explain the pervasive occurrence of complex multicellularity across the fungal tree of life.},

@article{Tilquin16,
	Abstract = {Theory predicts that sexual reproduction is difficult to maintain if asexuality is an option, yet sex is very common. To understand why, it is important to pay attention to repeatably occurring conditions that favour transitions to, or persistence of, asexuality. Geographic parthenogenesis is a term that has been applied to describe a large variety of patterns where sexual and related asexual forms differ in their geographic distribution. Often asexuality is stated to occur in a habitat that is, in some sense, marginal, but the interpretation differs across studies: parthenogens might not only predominate near the margin of the sexuals' distribution, but might also extend far beyond the sexual range; they may be disproportionately found in newly colonizable areas (e.g. areas previously glaciated), or in habitats where abiotic selection pressures are relatively stronger than biotic ones (e.g. cold, dry). Here, we review the various patterns proposed in the literature, the hypotheses put forward to explain them, and the assumptions they rely on. Surprisingly, few mathematical models consider geographic parthenogenesis as their focal question, but all models for the evolution of sex could be evaluated in this framework if the (often ecological) causal factors vary predictably with geography. We also recommend broadening the taxa studied beyond the traditional favourites.This article is part of the themed issue 'Weird sex: the underappreciated diversity of sexual reproduction'.},

@article{Lynch1983,
	Abstract = {Using phenotypic selection models directly coupled to the polygenic system, we examine the validity of the common assertion that obligate parthenogenesis is an evolutionary dead end. As is true for bisexual organisms, an equilibrium level of genetic variance is attained under obligate parthenogenesis when the input via mutation is balanced by the output via selection. We show that for most parthenogens this equilibrium will be reached within a few hundred generations. When the ability of ameiotic parthenogens to utilize the dominance and epistatic components of genetic variance and possible elevated mutation rates and reduced levels of environmental sensitivity in parthenogens are accounted for, it becomes clear that the rate of phenotypic evolution of well-established parthenogens may often approach or even exceed that under obligate bisexuality. We also examine the consequences of periodic sex. By exploiting hidden genetic variance released by sex, cyclical parthenogenesis periodically allows much higher rates of phenotypic evolution than can ever be attained under obligate bisexuality. In the long run, rates of phenotypic evolution are approximately independent of the frequency of sex for populations that have attained their equilibrium levels of genetic variance. It is suggested that cyclical parthenogenesis is rare not because of any inherent disadvantages, but because of the extremely stringent requirements necessary for the transition to and maintenance of such a complex life cycle. The possibility that occasional backcrosses between parthenogens and their bisexual parental species may play an important role in organic evolution is explored, and techniques are suggested for the future analysis of parthenogenetic systems.},

	Abstract = {In molecular phylogenies based on ribosomal RNA, three amitochondriate protist lineages, Microsporidia, Metamonada (including diplomonads) and Parabasala (including trichomonads), are the earliest offshoots of the eukaryotic tree. As an explanation for the lack of mitochondria in these organisms, the hypothesis that they have diverged before the mitochondrial endosymbiosis is preferred to the less parsimonious hypothesis of several independent losses of the organelle. Nevertheless, if they had descended from mitochondrion-containing ancestors, it may be possible to find in their nuclear DNA genes that derive from the endosymbiont which gave rise to mitochondria. Based on similar evidence, secondary losses of mitochondria have recently been suggested for Entamoeba histolytica and for Trichomonas vaginalis. In this study, we have isolated a gene encoding a chaperone protein (HSP70, 70 kDa heat shock protein) from the microsporidian Nosema locustae. In phylogenetic trees, this HSP70 was located within a group of sequences that in other lineages is targetted to the mitochondrial compartment, itself included in the proteobacterial clade. In addition, the N. locustae protein contained the GDAW(V) motif shared by mitochondrial and proteobacterial sequences, with only one conservative substitution. Moreover, microsporidia, a phylum which was assumed to emerge close to the base of the eukaryotic tree, appears as the sister-group of fungi in the HSP70 phylogeny, in agreement with some ultrastructural characters and phylogenies based on α- and β-tubulins. Loss of mitochondria, now demonstrated for several amitochondriate groups, indicates that the common ancestor of all the extant eukaryotic species could have been a mitochondriate eukaryote.},

@article{Kokko17,
	Abstract = {Does the progress in understanding evolutionary theory depend on the species that is doing the investigation? This question is difficult to answer scientifically, as we are dealing with an n = 1 scenario: every individual who has ever written about evolution is a human being. I will discuss, first, whether we get the correct answer to questions if we begin with ourselves and expand outwards, and second, whether we might fail to ask all the interesting questions unless we combat our tendencies to favour taxa that are close to us. As a whole, the human tendency to understand general biological phenomena via 'putting oneself in another organism's shoes' has upsides and downsides. As an upside, our intuitive ability to rethink strategies if the situation changes can lead to ready generation of adaptive hypotheses. Downsides occur if we trust this intuition too much, and particular danger zones exist for traits where humans are an unusual species. I argue that the levels of selection debate might have proceeded differently if human cooperation patterns were not so unique, as this brings about unique challenges in biology teaching; and that theoretical insights regarding inbreeding avoidance versus tolerance could have spread faster if we were not extrapolating our emotional reactions to incest disproportionately depending on whether we study animals or plants. I also discuss patterns such as taxonomic chauvinism, i.e. less attention being paid to species that differ more from human-like life histories. Textbooks on evolution reinforce such biases insofar as they present, as a default case, systems that resemble ours in terms of life cycles and other features (e.g. gonochorism). Additionally, societal norms may have led to incorrect null hypotheses such as females not mating multiply.},

A key issue is how variation in lower?level individuals generates a corporate (collective) entity with Darwinian characteristics. Of central importance to this process is the evolution of a means of collective reproduction, however, the evolution of a means of collective reproduction is not a trivial issue, requiring careful consideration of mechanistic details. Calling upon observations from experiments, we draw attention to proto?life cycles that emerge via unconventional routes and that transition, in single steps, individuality to higher levels. One such life cycle arises from conflicts among levels of selection and invokes cheats as a primitive germ line: it lays the foundation for collective reproduction, the basis of a self?policing system, the selective environment for the emergence of development, and hints at a plausible origin for a soma/germ line distinction.},

	Abstract = {The green lineage is reportedly 1,500 million years old, evolving shortly after the endosymbiosis event that gave rise to early photosynthetic eukaryotes. In this study, we unveil the complete genome sequence of an ancient member of this lineage, the unicellular green alga Ostreococcus tauri (Prasinophyceae). This cosmopolitan marine primary producer is the world's smallest free-living eukaryote known to date. Features likely reflecting optimization of environmentally relevant pathways, including resource acquisition, unusual photosynthesis apparatus, and genes potentially involved in C(4) photosynthesis, were observed, as was downsizing of many gene families. Overall, the 12.56-Mb nuclear genome has an extremely high gene density, in part because of extensive reduction of intergenic regions and other forms of compaction such as gene fusion. However, the genome is structurally complex. It exhibits previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity for a eukaryote. Two chromosomes differ structurally from the other eighteen. Both have a significantly biased G+C content, and, remarkably, they contain the majority of transposable elements. Many chromosome 2 genes also have unique codon usage and splicing, but phylogenetic analysis and composition do not support alien gene origin. In contrast, most chromosome 19 genes show no similarity to green lineage genes and a large number of them are specialized in cell surface processes. Taken together, the complete genome sequence, unusual features, and downsized gene families, make O. tauri an ideal model system for research on eukaryotic genome evolution, including chromosome specialization and green lineage ancestry.},

	N2 = {Abstract Understanding the mechanisms that can lead to the evolution of cooperation through natural selection is a core problem in biology. Among the various attempts at constructing a theory of cooperation, game theory has played a central role. Here, we review models of cooperation that are based on two simple games: the Prisoner's Dilemma, and the Snowdrift game. Both games are two?person games with two strategies, to cooperate and to defect, and both games are social dilemmas. In social dilemmas, cooperation is prone to exploitation by defectors, and the average payoff in populations at evolutionary equilibrium is lower than it would be in populations consisting of only cooperators. The difference between the games is that cooperation is not maintained in the Prisoner's Dilemma, but persists in the Snowdrift game at an intermediate frequency. As a consequence, insights gained from studying extensions of the two games differ substantially. We review the most salient results obtained from extensions such as iteration, spatial structure, continuously variable cooperative investments, and multi?person interactions. Bridging the gap between theoretical and empirical research is one of the main challenges for future studies of cooperation, and we conclude by pointing out a number of promising natural systems in which the theory can be tested experimentally.},

@article{Weinberger17,
	Abstract = {Animals are characterized by a set of highly conserved developmental regulators. Changes in the cis-regulatory elements of these regulators are thought to constitute the major driver of morphological evolution. However, the role of coding sequence evolution remains unresolved. To address this question, we used the Atonal family of proneural transcription factors as a model. Drosophila atonal coding sequence was endogenously replaced with that of atonal homologues (ATHs) at key phylogenetic positions, non-ATH proneural genes, and the closest homologue to ancestral proneural genes. ATHs and the ancestral-like coding sequences rescued sensory organ fate in atonal mutants, in contrast to non-ATHs. Surprisingly, different ATH factors displayed different levels of proneural activity as reflected by the number and functionality of sense organs. This proneural potency gradient correlated directly with ATH protein stability, including in response to Notch signaling, independently of mRNA levels or codon usage. This establishes a distinct and ancient function for ATHs and demonstrates that coding sequence evolution can underlie quantitative variation in sensory development and function.

Profiling of gene expression is traditionally based on measurements of steady-state mRNA levels, but recent studies have shown that mRNA and protein levels are highly discordant, suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms play a dominant role in modulating protein abundance. Here we combine measurements of mRNA, translation and protein across the mammalian cell cycle to uncover the hidden complexity of cell cycle regulation. Using this approach, we gain insights into the dynamics of protein synthesis and degradation and identify new genes and functions that cycle through cell division by periodic changes in translation or degradation rates. Integrative multi-omic analyses combining information on the transcriptome, translatome and proteome hold great promise for providing transformative biological insights in a variety of model systems.},

Here, we develop a new simulation model of gene networks to study the adaptive landscape underlying the evolution of robustness to noise. We find that epistatic interactions between the determinants of the expression of a gene and its downstream effect impose significant constraints on evolution, but these interactions do allow the gradual evolution of increased robustness. Despite strong sign epistasis, adaptation rarely proceeds via deleterious intermediate steps, but instead occurs primarily through small beneficial mutations. A simple mathematical model captures the relevant features of the single?gene fitness landscape and explains counterintuitive patterns, such as a correlation between the mean and standard deviation of phenotypes. In more complex networks, mutations in regulatory regions provide evolutionary pathways to increased robustness. These results chart the constraints and possibilities of adaptation to reduce expression noise and demonstrate the potential of a novel modeling framework for gene networks.},

Here we present one class of such models, thermodynamic state ensemble models. We describe the biochemical derivation of the thermodynamic framework in simple terms, and lay out the mathematical components that comprise each model. These components include (1) the possible states of a promoter, where a state is defined as a particular arrangement of transcription factors bound to a DNA promoter, (2) the binding constants that describe the affinity of the protein--protein and protein--DNA interactions that occur in each state, and (3) whether each state is capable of transcribing. Using these components, we demonstrate how to compute a cis-regulatory function that encodes the probability of a promoter being active. Our intention is to provide enough detail so that readers with little background in thermodynamics can compose their own cis-regulatory functions. To facilitate this goal, we also describe a matrix form of the model that can be easily coded in any programming language. This formalism has great flexibility, which we show by illustrating how phenomena such as competition between transcription factors and cooperativity are readily incorporated into these models. Using this framework, we also demonstrate that Michaelis-like functions, another class of cis-regulatory models, are a subset of the thermodynamic framework with specific assumptions. By recasting Michaelis-like functions as thermodynamic functions, we emphasize the relationship between these models and delineate the specific circumstances representable by each approach. Application of thermodynamic state ensemble models is likely to be an important tool in unraveling the physical basis of combinatorial cis-regulation and in generating formalisms that accurately predict gene expression from DNA sequence.},

	Abstract = {Proteins able to participate in unrelated biological processes have been grouped under the generic name of moonlighting proteins. Work with different yeast species has uncovered a great number of moonlighting proteins and shown their importance for adequate functioning of the yeast cell. Moonlighting activities in yeasts include such diverse functions as control of gene expression, organelle assembly, and modification of the activity of metabolic pathways. In this review, we consider several well-studied moonlighting proteins in different yeast species, paying attention to the experimental approaches used to identify them and the evidence that supports their participation in the unexpected function. Usually, moonlighting activities have been uncovered unexpectedly, and up to now, no satisfactory way to predict moonlighting activities has been found. Among the well-characterized moonlighting proteins in yeasts, enzymes from the glycolytic pathway appear to be prominent. For some cases, it is shown that despite close phylogenetic relationships, moonlighting activities are not necessarily conserved among yeast species. Organisms may utilize moonlighting to add a new layer of regulation to conventional regulatory networks. The existence of this type of proteins in yeasts should be taken into account when designing mutant screens or in attempts to model or modify yeast metabolism.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondria are highly dynamic cellular organelles, with the ability to change size, shape and position over the course of a few seconds. Many of these changes are related to the ability of mitochondria to undergo the highly co-ordinated processes of fission (division of a single organelle into two or more independent structures) or fusion (the opposing reaction). These actions occur simultaneously and continuously in many cell types, and the balance between them regulates the overall morphology of mitochondria within any given cell. Fission and fusion are active processes which require many specialized proteins, including mechanical enzymes that physically alter mitochondrial membranes, and adaptor proteins that regulate the interaction of these mechanical proteins with organelles. Although not fully understood, alterations in mitochondrial morphology appear to be involved in several activities that are crucial to the health of cells. In the present chapter we discuss the mechanisms behind mitochondrial fission and fusion, and discuss the implications of changes in organelle morphology during the life of a cell.},

	Abstract = {We derived novel, testable predictions from a mathematical model of the budding yeast cell cycle. A key qualitative prediction of bistability was confirmed in a strain simultaneously lacking cdc14 and G1 cyclins. The model correctly predicted quantitative dependence of cell size on gene dosage of the G1 cyclin CLN3, but it incorrectly predicted strong genetic interactions between G1 cyclins and the anaphase- promoting complex specificity factor Cdh1. To provide constraints on model generation, we determined accurate concentrations for the abundance of all nine cyclins as well as the inhibitor Sic1 and the catalytic subunit Cdc28. For many of these we determined abundance throughout the cell cycle by centrifugal elutriation, in the presence or absence of Cdh1. In addition, perturbations to the Clb-kinase oscillator were introduced, and the effects on cyclin and Sic1 levels were compared between model and experiment. Reasonable agreement was obtained in many of these experiments, but significant experimental discrepancies from the model predictions were also observed. Thus, the model is a strong but incomplete attempt at a realistic representation of cell cycle control. Constraints of the sort developed here will be important in development of a truly predictive model.},

	Abstract = {Most evolutionary thinking is based on the notion of fitness and related ideas such as fitness landscapes and evolutionary optima. Nevertheless, it is often unclear what fitness actually is, and its meaning often depends on the context. Here we argue that fitness should not be a basal ingredient in verbal or mathematical descriptions of evolution. Instead, we propose that evolutionary birth-death processes, in which individuals give birth and die at ever-changing rates, should be the basis of evolutionary theory, because such processes capture the fundamental events that generate evolutionary dynamics. In evolutionary birth-death processes, fitness is at best a derived quantity, and owing to the potential complexity of such processes, there is no guarantee that there is a simple scalar, such as fitness, that would describe long-term evolutionary outcomes. We discuss how evolutionary birth-death processes can provide useful perspectives on a number of central issues in evolution. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23804.001},

I argue that criticisms of the regression-based version of Hamilton's rule, although they undermine its use for predictive purposes, do not undermine its use as an organizing framework for social evolution research. I argue that the assumptions underlying the concept of inclusive fitness, conceived as a causal property of an individual organism, are unlikely to be exactly true in real populations, but they are approximately true given a specific type of weak selection that Hamilton took, on independent grounds, to be responsible for the cumulative assembly of complex adaptation. Finally, I reflect on the uses and limitations of `design thinking'in social evolution research.},

	Abstract = {How multicellular life forms evolved from unicellular ones constitutes a major problem in our understanding of the evolution of our biosphere. A recent set of experiments involving yeast cell populations have shown that selection for faster sedimenting cells leads to the appearance of stable aggregates of cells that are able to split into smaller clusters. It was suggested that the observed evolutionary patterns could be the result of evolved programmes affecting cell death. Here, we show, using a simple model of cell--cell interactions and evolving adhesion rates, that the observed patterns in cluster size and localized mortality can be easily interpreted in terms of waste accumulation and toxicity-driven apoptosis. This simple mechanism would have played a key role in the early evolution of multicellular life forms based on both aggregative and clonal development. The potential extensions of this work and its implications for natural and synthetic multicellularity are discussed.},

In this transition, single autonomously reproducing cells became parts of larger reproducing entities that eventually constituted a new unit of selection. The first step in the evolutionary transition to multicellularity likely was the evolution of simple, undifferentiated cell clusters. However, what the selective advantage of such cell clusters may have been remains unclear. Here, we argue that in populations of unicellular organisms with cooperative behavior, clustering may be beneficial by reducing interactions with noncooperative individuals. In support of this hypothesis, we present a set of computer simulations showing that clustering can evolve as a biological, heritable trait for cells that cooperate in the use of external energy resources. Following the evolution of simple cell clusters, further benefits could have arisen from the exchange of resources between cells of a cluster.},

	Abstract = {We do not know how or why multicellularity evolved. We used the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to ask whether nutrients that must be digested extracellularly select for the evolution of undifferentiated multicellularity. Because yeast use invertase to hydrolyze sucrose extracellularly and import the resulting monosaccharides, single cells cannot grow at low cell and sucrose concentrations. Three engineered strategies overcame this problem: forming multicellular clumps, importing sucrose before hydrolysis, and increasing invertase expression. We evolved populations in low sucrose to ask which strategy they would adopt. Of 12 successful clones, 11 formed multicellular clumps through incomplete cell separation, 10 increased invertase expression, none imported sucrose, and 11 increased hexose transporter expression, a strategy we had not engineered. Identifying causal mutations revealed genes and pathways, which frequently contributed to the evolved phenotype. Our study shows that combining rational design with experimental evolution can help evaluate hypotheses about evolutionary strategies. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00367.001},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that in liquid cultures, defined in this study as a mass habitat, the outcome of competition between Escherichia coli that produce an antibacterial toxin (colicin) and sensitive E. coli is frequency dependent; the colicinogenic bacteria are at an advantage only when fairly common (frequencies in excess of 2 X 10(-2)). However, we also show that in a soft agar matrix, a structured habitat, the colicinogenic bacteria have an advantage even when initially rare (frequencies as low as 10(-6)). These contrasting outcomes are attributed to the colicinogenic bacteria's lower intrinsic growth rate relative to the sensitive bacteria and the different manner in which bacteria and resources are partitioned in the two types of habitats. Bacteria in a liquid culture exist as randomly distributed individuals and the killing of sensitive bacteria by the colicin augments the amount of resource available to the colicinogenic bacteria to an extent identical to that experienced by the surviving sensitive bacteria. On the other hand, the bacteria in a soft agar matrix exist as single-clone colonies. As the colicinogenic colonies release colicin, they kill neighboring sensitive bacteria and form an inhibition zone around themselves. By this action, they increase the concentration of resources around themselves and overcome their growth rate disadvantage. We suggest that structured habitats are more favorable for the evolution of colicinogenic bacteria. IMAGES:},

Thus, the formation of larger groups can favor the aggregates to evolve to a configuration where division of labor arises. Assuming that the states of the cells in a group maximizes the per capita reproductive rate, we depict the processes affecting cells as kinetic chemical reactions by means of extensive computer simulations. In the model it is considered that the groups can grow linearly, forming a chain, or compactly keeping a roughly spherical shape. Starting from a population consisting of single-celled organisms, we observe the formation of groups with variable sizes and usually much larger than two-cell aggregates. Natural selection can favor the formation of large groups, which allows the system to achieve new and larger fitness maxima.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the emergence and evolution of multicellularity and cellular differentiation is a core problem in biology. We develop a quantitative model that shows that a multicellular form emerges from genetically identical unicellular ancestors when the compartmentalization of poorly compatible physiological processes into component cells of an aggregate produces a fitness advantage. This division of labour between the cells in the aggregate occurs spontaneously at the regulatory level owing to mechanisms present in unicellular ancestors and does not require any genetic predisposition for a particular role in the aggregate or any orchestrated cooperative behaviour of aggregate cells. Mathematically, aggregation implies an increase in the dimensionality of phenotype space that generates a fitness landscape with new fitness maxima, in which the unicellular states of optimized metabolism become fitness saddle points. Evolution of multicellularity is modelled as evolution of a hereditary parameter: the propensity of cells to stick together, which determines the fraction of time a cell spends in the aggregate form. Stickiness can increase evolutionarily owing to the fitness advantage generated by the division of labour between cells in an aggregate.},

After initial growth suppression there is a rapid increase in growth rate in G1, followed by a constant exponential growth phase. The probability of cell division varies independently with cell size and cell age. We conclude that proliferating mammalian cells have an intrinsic mechanism that maintains cell size.},

	Abstract = {Many RNAs, proteins, and organelles are present in such low numbers per cell that random segregation of individual copies causes large ``partitioning errors''at cell division. Even symmetrically dividing cells can then by chance produce daughters with very different composition. The size of the errors depends on the segregation mechanism: Control systems can reduce low-abundance errors, but the segregation process can also be subject to upstream sources of randomness or spatial heterogeneities that create large errors despite high abundances. Here we mathematically demonstrate how partitioning errors arise for different types of segregation mechanisms and how errors can be greatly increased by upstream heterogeneity but remarkably hard to avoid through controlled partitioning. We also show that seemingly straightforward experiments cannot be straightforwardly interpreted because very different mechanisms produce identical fits and present an approach to deal with this problem by adding binomial counting noise and testing for convexity or concavity in the partitioning error as a function of the binomial thinning parameter. The results lay a conceptual groundwork for more effective studies of heterogeneity among growing and dividing cells, whether in microbes or in differentiating tissues.},

	Abstract = {Gene expression involves many inherently probabilistic steps that create fluctuations in protein abundances between cells. A collection of in-depth analyses and genome-scale surveys have suggested how such noise arises and spreads through genetic networks, often as expected from stochastic models that predict statistical properties in terms of the rates of gene activation, transcription and translation. But noise also arises at cell division when molecules are partitioned stochastically between the two daughter cells. Here we mathematically demonstrate how such partitioning errors contribute to the non-genetic heterogeneity in a population. Our results show that partitioning errors are hard to correct, and that the resulting noise profiles closely mimic those of gene expression noise, making it remarkably difficult to separate between the two. By applying the results to previous experimental studies and distinguishing between actual creation versus mere transmission of noise we surprisingly hypothesize that much of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity that has been attributed to various aspects of gene expression instead comes from random segregation at cell division. We also propose experiments to separate between the two types of noise, and discuss future directions.},

	Abstract = {Fundamental to living cells is the capacity to differentiate into subtypes with specialized attributes. Understanding the way cells acquire their fates is a major challenge in developmental biology. How cells adopt a particular fate is usually thought of as being deterministic, and in the large majority of cases it is. That is, cells acquire their fate by virtue of their lineage or their proximity to an inductive signal from another cell. In some cases, however, and in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, cells choose one or another pathway of differentiation stochastically without apparent regard to environment or history. Stochasticity has important mechanistic requirements as we discuss. We will also speculate on why stochasticity is advantageous, and even critical in some circumstances, to the individual, the colony, or the species.},

This source of variation is becoming more and more apparent thanks to the recent advances in dynamic imaging and single-cell analysis. Some of these studies showed that the link between genotype and phenotype is not strictly deterministic. Mutations can change various statistical properties of a biochemical reaction, and thereby the probability of a trait outcome. The fact that they can modulate phenotypic noise brings up an intriguing question: how may selection act on these mutations? In this review, we approach this question by first covering the evidence that biological noise is under genetic control and therefore a substrate for evolution. We then sequentially inspect the possibilities of negative, neutral, and positive selection for mutations increasing biological noise. Finally, we hypothesize on the specific case of H2A.Z, which was shown to both buffer phenotypic noise and modulate transcriptional efficiency.},

Recent studies have shown that gene expression can be noisy, noise can be genetically controlled, genes and gene networks vary in how noisy they are and noise generates phenotypic differences among genetically identical cells. Such phenotypic differences can have fitness benefits, suggesting that evolution can shape noise and that noise may be adaptive. For example, gene networks can generate bistable states resulting in phenotypic diversity and switching among individual cells of a genotype, which may be a bet hedging strategy. Here, we review the sources of noise in gene expression, the extent to which noise in biological systems may be adaptive and suggest that applying evolutionary rigour to the study of noise is necessary to fully understand organismal phenotypes.},

Such stochastic cell-fate decisions generate non-genetic cellular diversity, which may be critical for metazoan development as well as optimized microbial resource utilization and survival in a fluctuating, frequently stressful environment. Here we review several examples of cellular decision-making from viruses, bacteria, yeast, lower metazoans and mammals, highlighting the role of regulatory network structure and molecular noise. We propose that cellular decision-making is one of at least three key processes underlying development at various scales of biological organization.},

Here I offer a model that posits that the origins of some cell differentiation patterns were originally passive outcomes of environmental effects. As cells' contact with the external environment was diminished, their patterns of gene expression were altered, due to changes in concentrations of externally supplied substances. Later, as multicellular growth continued, the relationships of cell layers to each other shifted, producing concentration gradients of signaling molecules. These gradients emanated both from the external cell layer toward the inside and from internal cell layers to adjacent layers. In this scenario then, differentiation arose initially as a by?product of the changing patterns of gene expression and of the complex mixtures and changing concentrations of substances passing among layers. Subsequent selection would operate to stabilize the expression patterns in those cell layers whose phenotypes provide a fitness advantage to the organism.},

This hypothesis can be tested in an organism, such as Volvox, where single germ cells can be cultured in isolation from the soma, thus serving both as source and sink, and their growth compared with that of germ cells with an intact soma where source and sink are separated into different cells. Results from such an experiment show that germ cells grown with an intact soma had greater rates of increase than those grown with disrupted soma or that were completely isolated, but the difference became greater as nutrient concentration increased, as predicted by the source-and-sink hypothesis. The advantage, however, was not sufficient to compensate fully for the initial investment in soma, especially at low nutrients, perhaps due to the energetic cost of swimming. In nature, species with segregated soma are found in nutrient-rich lakes and ponds. In experimental farm ponds, the biomass of such species increases with eutrophication more than the biomass of related species without division of labour, suggesting an advantage consistent with the source-and-sink.},

	Abstract = {The fitness of any evolutionary unit can be understood in terms of its two basic components: fecundity (reproduction) and viability (survival). Trade-offs between these fitness components drive the evolution of life-history traits in extant multicellular organisms. We argue that these trade-offs gain special significance during the transition from unicellular to multicellular life. In particular, the evolution of germ--soma specialization and the emergence of individuality at the cell group (or organism) level are also consequences of trade-offs between the two basic fitness components, or so we argue using a multilevel selection approach. During the origin of multicellularity, we study how the group trade-offs between viability and fecundity are initially determined by the cell level trade-offs, but as the transition proceeds, the fitness trade-offs at the group level depart from those at the cell level. We predict that these trade-offs begin with concave curvature in single-celled organisms but become increasingly convex as group size increases in multicellular organisms. We argue that the increasingly convex curvature of the trade-off function is driven by the cost of reproduction which increases as group size increases. We consider aspects of the biology of the volvocine green algae --which contain both unicellular and multicellular members --to illustrate the principles and conclusions discussed.},

During evolutionary transitions in individuality---such as, for instance, during the origin of the first cell, the origin of the eukaryotic cell and the origin of multicellular individuals---new kinds of individuals emerged from the interaction of previously independent entities. The question discussed here is: How can new types of individuals with qualities that cannot be reduced to the properties of their parts be created at a higher level? This question is addressed in the context of the transition to multicellularity and using the volvocine green algae---a group of closely related unicellular and multicellular species with various degrees of physiological and reproductive unity---as a model system. In this chapter, we review our framework to addressing the evolution of individuality during the transition to multicellularity, focusing on the reorganization of general life-traits and cellular processes and the cooption of environmentally-induced responses.},

The ubiquity of this division of labor suggests that it is highly advantageous. In this article I present a model to study the evolution of specialized cells. The model allows for unicellular and multicellular organisms that may contain somatic (terminally differentiated) cells. Cells contribute additively to a quantitative trait. The fitness of the organism depends on this quantitative trait (via a benefit function), the size of the organism, and the number of somatic cells. The model allows one to determine when somatic cells are advantageous and to calculate the optimum number (or fraction) of reproductive cells. I show that the fraction of reproductive cells is always surprisingly high. If somatic cells are very small, they can outnumber reproductive cells but their biomass is still less than the biomass of reproductive cells. I discuss the biology of primitive multicellular organisms with respect to the model predictions. I find a good agreement and outline how this work can be used to guide further quantitative studies of multicellularity.},

Fossils allow us to study the modification of specialized, multicellular features such as jaws, scales, and muscular appendages. But it is still unclear what organismal properties contributed to the transition from undifferentiated organisms, which contain only a single cell type, to multicellular organisms with specialized cells. Using digital organisms I study this transition. My simulations show that the transition to specialized cells happens faster in organism composed of many cells than in organisms composed of few cells. Large organisms suffer less from temporarily unsuccessful evolutionary experiments with individual cells, allowing them to evolve specialized cells via evolutionary trajectories that are unavailable to smaller organisms. This demonstrates that the evolution of simple multicellular organisms which are composed of many functionally identical cells accelerates the evolution of more complex organisms with specialized cells.},

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed genetic markers including major histocompatibility (MHC) genes, microsatellites, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in naturally occurring tumors and matched blood samples. In each case, the tumor is genetically distinct from its host. Moreover, tumors collected from 40 dogs in 5 continents are derived from a single neoplastic clone that has diverged into two subclades. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that CTVT most likely originated from a wolf or an East Asian breed of dog between 200 and 2500 years ago. Although CTVT is highly aneuploid, it has a remarkably stable genotype. During progressive growth, CTVT downmodulates MHC antigen expression. Our findings have implications for understanding genome instability in cancer, natural transplantation of allografts, and the capacity of a somatic cell to evolve into a transmissible parasite.},

	N2 = {Evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs) occur when formerly autonomous organisms evolve to become parts of a new, `higher-level'organism. One of the first major hurdles that must be overcome during an ETI is the emergence of Darwinian evolvability in the higher-level entity (e.g. a multicellular group), and the loss of Darwinian autonomy in the lower-level units (e.g. individual cells). Here, we examine how simple higher-level life cycles are a key innovation during an ETI, allowing this transfer of fitness to occur `for free'. Specifically, we show how novel life cycles can arise and lead to the origin of higher-level individuals by (i) mitigating conflicts between levels of selection, (ii) engendering the expression of heritable higher-level traits and (iii) allowing selection to efficiently act on these emergent higher-level traits. Further, we compute how canonical early life cycles vary in their ability to fix beneficial mutations via mathematical modelling. Life cycles that lack a persistent lower-level stage and develop clonally are far more likely to fix `ratcheting'mutations that limit evolutionary reversion to the pre-ETI state. By stabilizing the fragile first steps of an evolutionary transition in individuality, nascent higher-level life cycles may play a crucial role in the origin of complex life.This article is part of the themed issue `Process and pattern in innovations from cells to societies'.},

	N2 = {The evolutionary transition to multicellularity probably began with the formation of simple undifferentiated cellular groups. Such groups evolve readily in diverse lineages of extant unicellular taxa, suggesting that there are few genetic barriers to this first key step. This may act as a double-edged sword: labile transitions between unicellular and multicellular states may facilitate the evolution of simple multicellularity, but reversion to a unicellular state may inhibit the evolution of increased complexity. In this paper, we examine how multicellular adaptations can act as evolutionary `ratchets', limiting the potential for reversion to unicellularity. We consider a nascent multicellular lineage growing in an environment that varies between favouring multicellularity and favouring unicellularity. The first type of ratcheting mutations increase cell-level fitness in a multicellular context but are costly in a single-celled context, reducing the fitness of revertants. The second type of ratcheting mutations directly decrease the probability that a mutation will result in reversion (either as a pleiotropic consequence or via direct modification of switch rates). We show that both types of ratcheting mutations act to stabilize the multicellular state. We also identify synergistic effects between the two types of ratcheting mutations in which the presence of one creates the selective conditions favouring the other. Ratcheting mutations may play a key role in diverse evolutionary transitions in individuality, sustaining selection on the new higher-level organism by constraining evolutionary reversion.This article is part of the themed issue `The major synthetic evolutionary transitions'.},

Using experimental evolution, we show that key steps in this transition could have occurred quickly. We subjected the unicellular yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to an environment in which we expected multicellularity to be adaptive. We observed the rapid evolution of clustering genotypes that display a novel multicellular life history characterized by reproduction via multicellular propagules, a juvenile phase, and determinate growth. The multicellular clusters are uniclonal, minimizing within-cluster genetic conflicts of interest. Simple among-cell division of labor rapidly evolved. Early multicellular strains were composed of physiologically similar cells, but these subsequently evolved higher rates of programmed cell death (apoptosis), an adaptation that increases propagule production. These results show that key aspects of multicellular complexity, a subject of central importance to biology, can readily evolve from unicellular eukaryotes.},

	Abstract = {Multicellularity has evolved many times during eukaryote evolution. Deciphering the evolutionary transitions to multicellularity requires a robust deep phylogeny of eukaryotes to clarify the relationships amongst multicellular groups and determine their closest unicellular relatives. Here we review progress in understanding the phylogenetic relationships amongst multicellular and unicellular eukaryotes, as well as estimates of the ages of multicellular groups based on relaxed molecular clock (RMC) analyses. In addition, we present an RMC analysis of a large phylogenomic dataset to estimate the divergence dates of select major eukaryotic multicellular groups. Our analyses (and other recent studies) tentatively suggest that multicellular eukaryotes such as Metazoa, Fungi and two of the major multicellular red algal taxa first emerged in the mid-Neoproterozoic, whereas the dictyostelids arose in the Paleozoic. We also hypothesize that the first multicellular organisms emerged within 300--600 Myr after the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor. The age of land plants is less clear and is highly dependent on methodology, the genes analyzed, and the nature of fossil constraints. In general, there is great variability in all these age estimates, and their credible intervals frequently span hundreds of millions of years. These estimates are highly sensitive to both the models and methods of RMC analysis, as well as the manner in which fossil calibrations are treated in these analyses. As paleontological investigations continue to fill out the Proterozoic fossil record, genomic data is gathered from a greater diversity of eukaryotes and RMC methodology improves, we may converge on more precise estimates of the ages of multicellular eukaryotes that can be correlated with Earth's ancient geochemical record.},

The green alga, Chlorella vulgaris, is a well-studied eukaryote, which has retained its normal unicellular form in cultures in our laboratories for thousands of generations. For the experiments reported here, steady-state unicellular C. vulgaris continuous cultures were inoculated with the predator Ochromonas vallescia, a phagotrophic flagellated protist (`flagellate'). Within less than 100 generations of the prey, a multicellular Chlorella growth form became dominant in the culture (subsequently repeated in other cultures). The prey Chlorella first formed globose clusters of tens to hundreds of cells. After about 10--20 generations in the presence of the phagotroph, eight-celled colonies predominated. These colonies retained the eight-celled form indefinitely in continuous culture and when plated onto agar. These self-replicating, stable colonies were virtually immune to predation by the flagellate, but small enough that each Chlorella cell was exposed directly to the nutrient medium.},

	Abstract = {In this new assessment of the empirical evidence, an alternative to the standard model is proposed: group selection is the strong binding force in eusocial evolution; individual selection, the strong dissolutive force; and kin selection (narrowly defined), either a weak binding or weak dissolutive force, according to circumstance. Close kinship may be more a consequence of eusociality than a factor promoting its origin. A point of no return to the solitary state exists, as a rule when workers become anatomically differentiated. Eusociality has been rare in evolution, evidently due to the scarcity of environmental pressures adequate to tip the balance among countervailing forces in favor of group selection. Eusociality in ants and termites in the irreversible stage is the key to their ecological dominance and has (at least in ants) shaped some features of internal phylogeny. Their colonies are consistently superior to solitary and preeusocial competitors, due to the altruistic behavior among nestmates and their ability to organize coordinated action by pheromonal communication.},

Observations of cell and burrow construction and provisioning in Halictus rubicundus, Neocorynura fumipennis and Augochlorella sp. are included, with information on oviposition behavior, brood inspection, and interactions between females of H. rubicundus and N. fumipennis. The processes of cell construction, provisioning, pollen ball formation and oviposition were similar in all species observed. Reproductive females of solitary or weakly social species attacked other females more often than did those of the social species. The bees were maintained in an indoor insectary and nested in narrow, plexiglas-sided observation chambers.},

Eusocial societies are characterized by two traits: (1) helping by individuals of the less-reproductive caste, and (2) either behavioral totipotency of only the more reproductive caste (facultative eusociality) or totipotency of neither caste (obligate eusociality). We define ``cooperative breeding''as alloparental care without castes. Cooperatively breeding societies may comprise two types, semisocial (distribution of lifetime reproductive success bimodal), and quasisocial (distribution of lifetime reproductive success unimodal), but this hypothesis requires empirical analysis. Our definitions conceptually unify studies of arthropod and vertebrate sociality.},

These similarities form the basis for the proposal that multicellularity is ancestral to the clade containing animals, fungi, and Amoebozoa (including Dictyostelium): Amorphea (formerly ?unikonts?). This hypothesis is intriguing and if true could precipitate a paradigm shift. However, phylogenetic analyses of two key genes reveal patterns inconsistent with a single origin of multicellularity. A single origin in Amorphea would also require loss of multicellularity in each of the many unicellular lineages within this clade. Further, there are numerous other origins of multicellularity within eukaryotes, including three within Amorphea, that are not characterized by these structural and mechanistic similarities. Instead, convergent evolution resulting from similar selective pressures for forming multicellular structures with motile and differentiated cells is the most likely explanation for the observed similarities between animal and dictyostelid cell?cell connections.},

@article{Woese90,
	Abstract = {Molecular structures and sequences are generally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms). Consequently, the basis for the definition of taxa has progressively shifted from the organismal to the cellular to the molecular level. Molecular comparisons show that life on this planet divides into three primary groupings, commonly known as the eubacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three are very dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of a more profound nature than the differences that separate typical kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately, neither of the conventionally accepted views of the natural relationships among living systems--i.e., the five-kingdom taxonomy or the eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy--reflects this primary tripartite division of the living world. To remedy this situation we propose that a formal system of organisms be established in which above the level of kingdom there exists a new taxon called a "domain." Life on this planet would then be seen as comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eucarya, each containing two or more kingdoms. (The Eucarya, for example, contain Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and a number of others yet to be defined). Although taxonomic structure within the Bacteria and Eucarya is not treated herein, Archaea is formally subdivided into the two kingdoms Euryarchaeota (encompassing the methanogens and their phenotypically diverse relatives) and Crenarchaeota (comprising the relatively tight clustering of extremely thermophilic archaebacteria, whose general phenotype appears to resemble most the ancestral phenotype of the Archaea.},

	N2 = {Multicellularity has evolved at least once in every major eukaryotic clade (in all ploidy levels) and numerous times among the prokaryotes. According to a standard multilevel selection (MLS) model, in each case, the evolution of multicellularity required the acquisition of cell?cell adhesion, communication, cooperation, and specialization attended by a compulsory alignment?of?fitness phase and an export?of?fitness phase to eliminate cell?cell conflict and to establish a reproductively integrated phenotype. These achievements are reviewed in terms of generalized evolutionary developmental motifs (or ?modules?) whose overall logic constructs were mobilized and executed differently in bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals. When mapped onto a matrix of theoretically possible body plan morphologies (i.e., a morphospace), these motifs and the MLS model identify a ?unicellular ? colonial ? multicellular? transformation series of body plans that mirrors trends observed in the majority of algae (i.e., a polyphyletic collection of photoautotrophic eukaryotes) and in the land plants, fungi, and animals. However, an alternative, more direct route to multicellularity theoretically exists, which may account for some aspects of fungal and algal evolution, i.e., a ?siphonous ? multicellular? transformation series. This review of multicellularity attempts to show that natural selection typically acts on functional traits rather than on the mechanisms that generate them (?Many roads lead to Rome.?) and that genome sequence homologies do not invariably translate into morphological homologies (?Rome isn't what it used to be.?).},

Theoretically, in each case, this involved (1) cell?to?cell adhesion with an alignment?of?fitness among cells, (2) cell?to?cell communication, cooperation, and specialization with an export?of?fitness to a multicellular organism, and (3) in some cases, a transition from ?simple? to ?complex? multicellularity. When mapped onto a matrix of morphologies based on developmental and physical rules for plants, these three phases help to identify a ?unicellular???colonial???filamentous (unbranched???branched)???pseudoparenchymatous???parenchymatous? morphological transformation series that is consistent with trends observed within each of the three major plant clades. In contrast, a more direct ?unicellular???colonial or siphonous???parenchymatous? series is observed in fungal and animal lineages. In these contexts, we discuss the roles played by the cooptation, expansion, and subsequent diversification of ancestral genomic toolkits and patterning modules during the evolution of multicellularity. We conclude that the extent to which multicellularity is achieved using the same toolkits and modules (and thus the extent to which multicellularity is homologous among different organisms) differs among clades and even among some closely related lineages.},

For instance, recently Gerhart and Kirschner2 have argued that a multicellular organism has gained the advantage of a unicellular ancestor because it can more effectively shield itself from the vagaries of the environment by producing its own internal environment. In broader terms, this is Dawkins'3 argument that a competitively effective way of carrying the genes from one generation to the next is by building a complex soma that safely sees to it that the germ plasm survives. ? 1998 Wiley?Liss, Inc.},

@article{Dodd17,
	Abstract = {Although it is not known when or where life on Earth began, some of the earliest habitable environments may have been submarine-hydrothermal vents. Here we describe putative fossilized microorganisms that are at least 3,770 million and possibly 4,280 million years old in ferruginous sedimentary rocks, interpreted as seafloor-hydrothermal vent-related precipitates, from the Nuvvuagittuq belt in Quebec, Canada. These structures occur as micrometre-scale haematite tubes and filaments with morphologies and mineral assemblages similar to those of filamentous microorganisms from modern hydrothermal vent precipitates and analogous microfossils in younger rocks. The Nuvvuagittuq rocks contain isotopically light carbon in carbonate and carbonaceous material, which occurs as graphitic inclusions in diagenetic carbonate rosettes, apatite blades intergrown among carbonate rosettes and magnetite--haematite granules, and is associated with carbonate in direct contact with the putative microfossils. Collectively, these observations are consistent with an oxidized biomass and provide evidence for biological activity in submarine-hydrothermal environments more than 3,770 million years ago.},

A potential advantage of forming multicellular clumps is that it provides an efficiency benefit to pre-existing cooperation, such as the production of extracellular `public goods'. However, this is complicated by the fact that cooperation could jointly evolve with clumping, and clumping could have multiple consequences for the evolution of cooperation. We model the evolution of clumping and a cooperative public good, showing that (i) when considered separately, both clumping and public goods production gradually increase with increasing genetic relatedness; (ii) in contrast, when the traits evolve jointly, a small increase in relatedness can lead to a major shift in evolutionary outcome---from a non-clumping state with low public goods production to a cooperative clumping state with high values of both traits; (iii) high relatedness makes it easier to get to the cooperative clumping state and (iv) clumping can be inhibited when it increases the number of cells that the benefits of cooperation must be shared with, but promoted when it increases relatedness between those cells. Overall, our results suggest that public goods sharing can facilitate the formation of well-integrated cooperative clumps as a first step in the evolution of multicellularity.},
